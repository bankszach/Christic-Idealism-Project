- Nicholas Griffin & Andrew Irvine et al., “Alfred North Whitehead”, *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (1996; substantive revision 2022).
- Local copy: `Alfred North Whitehead (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).pdf` (text: `Alfred-Whitehead-SEP.txt`).

Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Main purpose: provide a clear, historically grounded snapshot of Whitehead’s development and his mature **process metaphysics** so we can:
  - justify using “process” and “internally related Whole” language,
  - see how far our “Whole and slices” ontology aligns with or departs from Whitehead,
  - identify which Whiteheadian ideas we explicitly adopt or reject (e.g., occasions vs slices, God’s role, creativity).
- We will primarily mine:
  - sections on **physics**, **metaphysics**, and **religion**,
  - Whitehead’s critique of “simple location” and scientific materialism,
  - his emphasis on events/processes and internal relations rather than isolated substances.

High-level structure of the SEP entry
-------------------------------------
- 1. Life and Works
  - Biographical overview: Cambridge mathematician and logician → London period (physics, philosophy of science, education) → Harvard metaphysician.
  - Key works:
    - *Principia Mathematica* (with Russell) – logicism, foundations of mathematics.
    - Later major works: *Science and the Modern World* (1925), *Process and Reality* (1929), *Religion in the Making* (1926), *Adventures of Ideas* (1933), *Modes of Thought* (1938).
  - No “school” during his lifetime, but major posthumous influence in process philosophy and process theology.
- 2. Mathematics and Logic
  - Early work in universal algebra and mathematical logic; collaboration with Russell on logicism.
  - Distinctive form of logicism, less purely “from within logic” than Frege’s:
    - Whitehead/Russell attend to the structure of pre-logicized mathematics and reconstruct branches with attention to their topic-specific features.
  - Whitehead values mathematical intuition and pattern recognition; sees symbolic logic as a **tool** for articulating patterns, not a replacement for intuition.
- 3. Physics
  - Engagement with Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, relativity; criticism of scientific materialism.
  - Diagnoses the **“barren”** combination of:
    - Newton’s world of matter-in-motion with no internal meaning or value.
    - Hume’s skepticism about causal necessity and induction.
  - Argues that:
    - Newton’s concept of **simple location** (isolated bits of matter with definite positions in space-time) is invalid for modern physics.
    - Electromagnetism shows that events and fields are **non-locally related**; each event depends on and affects a vast region of space-time.
    - Modern physics points toward a universe of **activity and process** rather than static, self-contained particles.
- 4. Philosophy of Science
  - Develops a critique of **scientific materialism**:
    - Science modeled as mere description of succession fails to provide meaning, value, or reasons for its formulas.
    - Pure sense-perception (in a Humean/positivist style) is too narrow; it omits key features of experience.
  - Emphasizes that scientific abstraction is powerful but partial; we must reconnect it with a richer account of experience and causality.
- 5. Philosophy of Education
  - Less central for our project, but echoes:
    - importance of **creative advance**,
    - integration of different modes of thought (scientific, aesthetic, moral).
- 6. Metaphysics
  - Mature process metaphysics in *Process and Reality*:
    - Reality is composed of **“actual occasions”** (events), not enduring substances.
    - Each occasion is a momentary process of becoming, internally related to the whole past of the universe.
    - Emphasis on **internal relations**: entities are constituted by their relations, not externally related bits.
    - World is characterized by **creativity** (ongoing process of becoming) and **concrescence** (process by which many become one in each occasion).
  - Rejects substance-ontology; proposes a relational, event-based ontology.
- 7. Religion
  - Develops a picture of God as:
    - not a coercive external agent, but a **“consequent”** and **“primordial”** nature:
      - primordial: ordering of possibilities (eternal objects),
      - consequent: receptacle of the world’s concrete achievements.
    - intimately linked with the world’s process, not wholly separate from it.
  - Whitehead’s God is:
    - involved in the world’s creative advance,
    - affected by the world (not immutable in the classical sense),
    - provides **aims** (lures for feeling) that orient occasions toward richer forms of value.
- 8. Influence
  - Process philosophy and process theology (Hartshorne, Cobb, Griffin, etc.).
  - Renewed interest via the Edinburgh Critical Edition of his works and publication of Harvard lectures.

Key philosophical themes relevant to Wholeframe
-----------------------------------------------
1. Critique of “simple location” and scientific materialism
   - Modern physics (especially electromagnetism) undermines the idea of self-sufficient material bits:
     - There are no purely local, isolated entities.
     - Events and fields are inherently relational and extended.
   - Whitehead’s lesson:
     - “There are no essentially self-contained activities within limited regions.”
     - “Nature is a theatre for the interrelations of activities. All things change, the activities and their interrelations.”
   - For Wholeframe:
     - Supports the claim that there is only the Whole, with slices as relational modes, not isolated substances.
     - Gives scientific-metaphysical backing for rejecting naive materialism and atomism.
2. Process and event ontology
   - World as **process**, not static being:
     - Reality is an ongoing “creative advance.”
     - Basic units are events/occasions of experience.
   - Internal relations:
     - Each actual occasion prehends (feels) the whole past, integrating it into a new unity.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - Our **Whole** can be viewed as the total process, with slices as constrained viewpoints on this process.
     - Our focus on **pattern source** and **training runs** resonates with actual occasions integrating past patterns into new ones.
3. Experience and perception
   - Whitehead criticizes a narrow focus on pure sense perception:
     - Introduces two pure modes of perception:
       - **Presentational immediacy** (sense-data, immediate spatial perception).
       - **Causal efficacy** (perception of causal relatedness, the feeling of the past acting on the present).
     - Our actual perception is a symbolic interplay of these modes.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - Our “pattern source” and “attention” can incorporate:
       - sense-based representations,
       - deeper, felt causal patterns (how the world impacts us and how we anticipate it).
     - This aligns with our insistence that most of what matters is non-narrative, embodied, and relational.
4. Value, meaning, and God
   - Whitehead insists that:
     - Scientific description lacking meaning and value is incomplete.
     - Our experience includes value, purpose, and creativity that must be part of metaphysics.
   - His God:
     - Offers a metaphysical anchor for value and directionality (aims).
   - For Wholeframe:
     - We can reinterpret:
       - Whitehead’s God-as-aim into our **lean** (value gradient of the Whole) and **Christ-pattern** as a clearer, personal disclosure of that lean.
     - We should state explicitly:
       - Where we agree: reality is value-laden, not neutral; there is a built-in orientation toward richer forms of order.
       - Where we differ: we treat the **Whole** itself as the ground, and Christ/Spirit as specific modes of its self-expression (Trinity), rather than Whitehead’s dipolar God + world schema.

Explicit connections to Wholeframe sections
-------------------------------------------
- Whole / slice ontology
  - Use Whitehead to support:
    - rejection of substance-atomism,
    - embrace of a processual, relational view.
  - Difference:
    - Whiteframe uses **slices** (Whole-under-constraints) rather than Whitehead’s actual occasions as basic units.
    - We may interpret slices as aggregates of many occasions, or as higher-level interfaces.
- Constraints, pattern source, attention
  - Whitehead’s emphasis on:
    - the way each occasion integrates its past (pattern),
    - the role of subjective aim and feeling.
  - Can inform:
    - our view of pattern source as a dynamic integration of past experience,
    - attention as the lived selection and weighting of relations/prehensions.
- Lean / value gradient
  - Whitehead:
    - world has an inherent drive toward richer, more intense forms of experience (creative advance toward value).
  - Wholeframe:
    - “lean” toward coherence, love, relational order.
  - Use Whitehead to:
    - show that a value-laden metaphysics is philosophically serious and has precedent,
    - frame our lean as a Christ-shaped articulation of this value orientation.
- Christ-pattern and Trinity
  - SEP entry mainly sets up Whitehead’s process theology background; it doesn’t itself do detailed Christology.
  - For our purposes:
    - Whitehead’s process God → conversation partner for:
      - our **Whole as Father** (ground),
      - our Christ-pattern (form),
      - our Spirit-as-attention (movement).
    - We can contrast:
      - process theism’s dipolar God-world relation,
      - our more explicitly Trinitarian, Christ-centered mapping.

How to use this SEP article in `paper/main.tex`
-----------------------------------------------
- Early sections (“The Whole and the Slice”)
  - Cite the SEP article (`whitehead1978process` plus SEP itself) when:
    - introducing process metaphysics,
    - rejecting simple location and atomistic materialism,
    - emphasizing internal relations and activity.
- Comparative / background section
  - In `Comparative and Future Directions`, explicitly:
    - mention process philosophy / Whitehead as a key dialogue partner,
    - note points of alignment (process, internal relations, value-ladenness),
    - note divergences (Trinity, Christ, overall structure of the Whole).
- Footnotes or sidebars
  - Use short quotes/paraphrases from the SEP overview to:
    - define “process philosophy,”
    - summarize the critique of Newton/Hume,
    - articulate the idea of Nature as “theatre of interrelations.”

Open questions / cautions for our project
-----------------------------------------
- Basic units: occasions vs slices
  - Are we comfortable staying at the level of slices (persons, finite minds), or do we want to echo Whitehead and hint at finer-grained occasions?
  - For Stage 1, likely best to:
    - keep “slice” as our central unit,
    - acknowledge that there may be deeper microstructure but leave that for later.
- God/Whole relation
  - Whitehead’s God is within a broader metaphysical system (God + world + creativity).
  - Our Whole-as-ground may look closer to a panentheistic or idealist monism.
  - We need to be explicit:
    - we are inspired by process metaphysics, but we are not offering a straightforward Whiteheadian system.
- Technical depth
  - The SEP is dense and references many debates; we should avoid importing technicalities that don’t serve our framework.
  - Use it mainly to:
    - legitimize process and internal-relations talk,
    - anchor our references to *Process and Reality* and related works.

Next steps with this source
---------------------------
- Decide which 2–3 Whitehead texts to explicitly cite beyond the SEP:
  - likely *Process and Reality* and *Science and the Modern World*.
- In `paper/refs.bib`, ensure:
  - `whitehead1978process` is present (it is),
  - optionally add an entry for the SEP article itself as a secondary source.
- In `paper/main.tex`, revise:
  - the early metaphysics sections to:
    - mention process metaphysics and Whitehead as context,
    - highlight our agreement (process, internal relations, value) and differences (Trinity, Christ, Whole/slice language).
