Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Provides a general, computation-based account of **observers**:
  - what they do (equivalencing, reduction, coarse-graining),
  - how their assumptions and limitations shape the laws they infer.
- Directly relevant to:
  - our notion of **slice** (Whole under constraints),
  - **attention** as equivalencing and feature selection,
  - the dependence of apparent laws/structures on observer type.

Core ideas (from the excerpt)
-----------------------------
1. Observation as reduced representation via equivalencing
   - Observation/perception/measurement/analysis:
     - all about taking the world “as it is” and deriving an **impression** in a finite mind.
   - We can’t (and don’t) track all micro-details (e.g., individual photons or gas molecules).
   - Instead:
     - observers extract **reduced representations**:
       - visual scenes, overall pressure, statistics, etc.
   - Fundamental operation:
     - **equivalencing**:
       - many underlying configurations are treated as equivalent from the observer’s perspective.

2. Duality between computation and observation
   - Computation:
     - generates new states via underlying rules.
   - Observation:
     - **equivalences** together different states (collapses many to few).
   - Equivalencing is implemented underneath by computation in the observer, but observer theory:
     - aims to characterize the equivalencing itself at an abstract level.

3. Observers as finite, structured subsystems of the ruliad
   - Ruliad:
     - entangled limit of all possible computations; “the whole computational universe.”
   - Observers:
     - embedded structures within the ruliad.
   - Key move in observer theory:
     - one can make conclusions about an observer’s **impression of the world** from:
       - the capabilities and assumptions of the observer,
       - without needing full internal detail.

4. Computational boundedness and persistence in time
   - In Wolfram’s Physics Project:
     - 20th-century physics (general relativity, quantum mechanics, Second Law) emerges from:
       - features of us as observers, notably:
         - **computational boundedness** (finite minds),
         - belief in **persistence in time** (we see ourselves as the same entity over time, though underlying atoms change).
   - Idea:
     - given certain observer assumptions, specific “natural laws” follow from the ruliad’s structure.
   - Other assumptions:
     - persistence of objects, belief in free will, etc.
     - may lead to additional inferred structures.

5. Observers beyond physics
   - Observer theory is not limited to physical measurement:
     - applies whenever we “get an impression” of something.
   - We can be:
     - **physical observers** (measuring physical systems),
     - **mathematical observers** (sampling the ruliad for mathematical laws),
     - etc.
   - Some observer features carry across (e.g., computational boundedness), others vary.

6. Operation of observers: aggregation and attractors
   - Human senses and technological measures:
     - typically **aggregate** large numbers of micro-inputs into:
       - averaged outputs (e.g., real numbers),
       - or discrete outputs (threshold-based decisions).
   - Many input configurations evolve to the same **attractor state** in the measuring device:
     - formalizes equivalencing as dynamics converging to common outputs.
   - Example:
     - measuring gas pressure via a piston:
       - many molecular impacts → single macroscopic force reading.

Connections to Wholeframe ontology
----------------------------------
1. Slice as observer
   - Our **slice**:
     - Whole under particular constraints, functioning as an **observer** in Wolfram’s sense.
   - Constraints:
     - determine:
       - which equivalencings are possible,
       - what reduced representations a slice can form,
       - which regularities it can detect.
   - This aligns:
     - slice = observer with specific computational bounds and assumptions.

2. Attention as equivalencing and coarse-graining
   - Attention:
     - selects what is foreground/background, which features matter.
   - In observer-theory terms:
     - attention configures equivalencing:
       - which microstates are grouped,
       - which reduced variables (concepts, patterns) are extracted.
   - Training runs:
     - shape the equivalencing habits of a slice (its pattern source), influencing future observation and interpretation.

3. Laws and structures as observer-relative
   - Wolfram:
     - physical laws depend on observer assumptions (boundedness, persistence).
   - Wholeframe:
     - “laws” and structural regularities experienced by slices:
       - are influenced by their constraints and pattern sources.
   - Implication:
     - the same underlying Whole can yield:
       - different apparent laws/structures for different kinds of slices/observers.

4. Whole vs ruliad
   - Whole:
     - all that is; undivided reality.
   - Ruliad:
     - all possible computations/causal structures.
   - We can:
     - treat ruliad as a computational model for the Whole’s possibilities.
   - Observer theory:
     - shows how different slices/observers extract different “views” of the same underlying Whole/ruliad.

How to use this source
----------------------
- In the “Slices, Constraints, and the Observer” / “Pattern Source and Attention” sections:
  - cite observer theory when:
    - framing slices as finite, computationally bounded observers,
    - explaining attention as equivalencing + coarse-graining across microstates.
- In comparative/future directions:
  - mention that:
    - our framework connects naturally with Wolfram’s observer theory, suggesting:
      - specific ways to formalize slice-relative laws and experiences.
