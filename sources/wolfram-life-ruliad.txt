Towards a Theory of Bulk Orchestration
It’s a key feature of living systems, perhaps even in some ways the key feature:
that even right down to a molecular scale, things are orchestrated. Molecules (or
at least large ones) don’t just move around randomly, like in a liquid or a gel.
Instead, what molecular biology has discovered is that there are endless active
mechanisms that in effect orchestrate what even individual molecules in living
systems do. But what is the result of all that orchestration? And could there

perhaps be a general characterization of what happens in systems that exhibit
such “bulk orchestration”? I’ve been wondering about these questions for some
time. But finally now I think I may have the beginnings of some answers.
The central idea is to consider the effect that “being adapted for an overall
purpose” has on the underlying operation of a system. At the outset, one might
imagine that there’d be no general answer to this, and that it would always
depend on the specifics of the system and the purpose. But what we’ll discover is
that there is in fact typically a certain universality in what happens. Its ultimate
origin is the Principle of Computational Equivalence and certain universal
features of the phenomenon of computational irreducibility that it implies. But
the point is that so long as a purpose is somehow “computationally simple” then
—more or less regardless of what in detail the purpose is—a system that achieves
it will show certain features in its behavior.
Whenever there’s computational irreducibility we can think of it as exerting a
powerful force towards unpredictability and randomness (as it does, for example,
in the Second Law of thermodynamics). So for a system to achieve an overall
“computationally simple purpose” this computational irreducibility must in some
sense be tamed, or at least contained. And in fact it’s an inevitable feature of
computational irreducibility that within it there must be “pockets of
computational reducibility” where simpler behavior occurs. And at some level the
way computationally simple purposes must be achieved is by tapping into those
pockets of reducibility.
When there’s computational irreducibility it means that there’s no simple
narrative one can expect to give of how a system behaves, and no overall
“mechanism” one can expect to identify for it. But one can think of pockets of
computational reducibility as corresponding to at least small-scale “identifiable
mechanisms”. And what we’ll discover is that when there’s a “simple overall
purpose” being achieved these mechanisms tend to become more manifest. And
this means that when a system is achieving an overall purpose there’s a trace of
this even down in the detailed operation of the system. And that trace is what I’ve
called “mechanoidal behavior”—behavior in which there are at least small-scale

“mechanism-like phenomena” that we can think of as acting together through
“bulk orchestration” to achieve a certain overall purpose.
The concept that there might be universal features associated with the interplay
between some kind of overall simplicity and underlying computational
irreducibility is something not unfamiliar. Indeed, in various forms it’s the
ultimate key to our recent progress in the foundations of physics, mathematics
and, in fact, biology.
In our effort to get a general understanding of bulk orchestration and the
behavior of systems that “achieve purposes” there’s an analogy we can make to
statistical mechanics. One might have imagined that to reach conclusions about,
say, gases, we’d have to have detailed information about the motion of molecules.
But in fact we know that if we just consider the whole ensemble of possible
configurations of molecules, then by taking statistical averages we can deduce all
sorts of properties of gases. (And, yes, the foundational reason this works we can
now understand in terms of computational irreducibility, etc.)
So could we perhaps do something similar for bulk orchestration? Is there some
ensemble we can identify in which wherever we look there will with
overwhelming probability be certain properties? In the statistical mechanics of
gases we imagine that the underlying laws of mechanics are fixed, but there’s a
whole ensemble of possible initial configurations for the molecules—almost all of
which turn out to have the same limiting features. But in biology, for example, we
can think of different genomes as defining different rules for the development
and operation of organisms. And so now what we want is a new kind of ensemble
—that we can call a rulial ensemble: an ensemble of possible rules.
But in something like biology, it’s not all possible rules we want; rather, it’s rules
that have been selected to “achieve the purpose” of making a successful organism.
We don’t have a general way to characterize what defines biological fitness. But
the key point here is that at a fundamental level we don’t need that. Instead it
seems that just knowing that our fitness function is somehow computationally
simple tells us enough to be able to deduce properties of our “rulial ensemble”.
But are the fitness functions of biology in fact computationally simple? I’ve
recently argued that their simplicity is precisely what makes biological evolution

possible. Like so many other foundational phenomena, it seems that biological
evolution is a reflection of the interplay between computational simplicity—in the
case of fitness functions—and underlying computational irreducibility. (In effect,
organisms have a chance only because the problems they have to solve aren’t too
computationally difficult.) But now we can use the simplicity of fitness functions
—without knowing any more details about them—to make conclusions about the
relevant rulial ensemble, and from there to begin to derive general principles
associated with bulk orchestration.
When one describes why a system does what it does, there are two different
approaches one can take. One can go from the bottom up and describe the
underlying rules by which the system operates (in effect, its “mechanism”). Or
one can go from the top down and describe what the system “achieves” (in effect,
its “goal” or “purpose”). It tends to be difficult to mix these two approaches. But
what we’re going to find here is that by thinking in terms of the rulial ensemble
we will be able to see the general pattern of both the “upward” effect of
underlying rules, and the “downward” effect of overall purposes.
What I’ll do here is just a beginning—a first exploration, both computational and
conceptual, of the rulial ensemble and its consequences. But already there seem
to be strong indications that by thinking in terms of the rulial ensemble one may
be able to develop what amounts to a foundational theory of bulk orchestration,
and with it a foundational theory of certain aspects of adaptive systems, and most
notably biology.
Some First Examples
To begin our explorations and start developing our intuition let’s look at a few
simple examples. We’ll use the same basic framework as in my recent work on
biological evolution. The idea is to have cellular automata whose rules serve as an
idealization of genotypes, and whole behavior serves as an idealization of the
development of phenotypes. For our fitness function we’re going to start with
something very specific: that after 50 steps (starting from a single-cell “seed”) our
cellular automaton should generate “output” that consists of three equal blocks of
cells colored red, blue and yellow.

Here are some examples of rules that “solve this particular problem”, in various
different ways:
How can such rules be found? Well, we can use an idealization of biological
evolution. Let’s consider the first rule above:
We start, say, from a null rule, then make successive random point mutations in
the rule

keeping those mutations that don’t take us further from achieving our goal (and
dropping those that do, each indicated here by a red dot):
The result is that we “progressively adapt” over the course of a few thousand
mutations to successively reduce the number of “errors” and eventually (and in
this case, perfectly) achieve our goal:
Early in this sequence there’s lots of computational irreducibility in evidence. But
in the process of adapting to achieve our goal the computational irreducibility
progressively gets “contained” and in effect squeezed out, until eventually the
final solution in this case has an almost completely simple structure.
The example we’ve just seen succeeds in exactly achieving the objective we
defined—though it takes about 4000 steps of adaptive evolution to do so. But if

we limit the number of steps of adaptive evolution then in general we won’t be
able to reach the exact objective we’ve defined. But here are some results we get
with 10,000 steps of adaptive evolution (sorted by how close they get):
In all cases there’s a certain amount of “identifiable mechanism” to what these
rules do. Yes, there can be patches of complex—and presumably computationally
irreducible—behavior. But particularly the rules that do better at achieving our
exact objective tend to “keep this computational irreducibility at bay”, and
emphasize their “simple mechanisms”.
So what we see is that among all possible rules, those that get even close to
achieving the “purpose” we have set in effect show at least “patches of
mechanism”. In other words, the imposition of a purpose selects out rules that
“exhibit mechanism”, and show what we’ve called mechanoidal behavior.
The Concept of Mutational Complexity
In the last section we saw that adaptive evolution can find (4-color) cellular
automaton rules that generate the particular 
 output we specified. But
what about other kinds of output?

What we manage to get will depend on how much “effort” of adaptive evolution
we put in. If we limit ourselves to 10,000 steps of adaptive evolution here are
some examples of what happens:
