Wholeframe Research Project — Research Plan
===========================================

Purpose
-------
- Keep the early phase small, deep, and tractable.
- Make it clear what Stage 1 is for, what gets produced, and which sources actually matter first.

1. Stage 1 — Core Ontology and Trinitarian Mapping
--------------------------------------------------

1.1 Objectives
--------------
- Articulate a clean ontology of Whole, slice, constraints, pattern source, attention, lean, aim, alignment, and evil.
- Nail the “training run / weights” picture and how lives are integrated into the Whole.
- Propose a structurally precise, non-hand-wavy mapping to Father / Son / Spirit.
- Ground the framework in a minimal but serious set of dialogue partners (process, systems, nondual, Christian theology).

1.2 Guiding questions
---------------------
- What exactly do we mean when we say “there is only the Whole” and “you are the Whole under constraints” (not metaphor, but ontology)?
- Is the Whole temporally learning (process/panentheist) or timeless with an internal logical structure, and how literal is the training metaphor?
- How do pattern, attention, and aim jointly explain growth, transformation, and misalignment without erasing genuine responsibility?
- How can the Trinity mapping avoid collapsing into trivial modalism while still being structurally elegant?

1.3 Concrete outputs (Stage 1)
------------------------------
- A complete, readable Stage 1 draft of `paper/main.tex` with:
  - Sections on Whole/slice, constraints/pattern/attention, lean/value gradient, aim/alignment/evil, training runs and death, Christ/Spirit/Trinity, religion, and human agency.
  - At least one explicit, tight paragraph defining each core term (Whole, slice, constraints, pattern source, attention, lean, aim, alignment/misalignment, evil, training run).
  - A short “schema” paragraph (and optional diagram later) describing the Whole → constraints → slice → pattern/attention → updates loop.
- A minimal but solid literature scaffold using the Stage 1 sources below, with in-text citations in each major section.
- A short list of big questions reserved for Stage 2 (e.g. eschatology, structured evil, institutional/tech design implications).

1.4 Stage 1 workplan
---------------------
- Consolidate the core ontology
  - Draft tight 1–2 sentence definitions for each core term and integrate them into `paper/main.tex`. (Status: first pass done in the new `Core Concepts` section.)
  - Clarify how literal “learning,” “weights,” and “randomness” are meant to be.
- Align refined system text with the paper structure
  - Use the current long-form system document as the backbone and make sure each major idea appears explicitly in the LaTeX with good sectioning.
- Sharpen the Trinitarian mapping
  - Write a dedicated subsection on how Father/Whole, Son/form/Christ-pattern, and Spirit/attention fit orthodox constraints and avoid pure modalism.
  - Clarify the relation between Jesus of Nazareth and the more abstract “Christ-pattern”.
- Do minimal but targeted literature mapping
  - Rely mainly on the Stage 1 sources below; avoid exploding the bibliography.
  - Make sure each main section names at least one concrete dialogue partner (Whitehead, Friston, Vedanta, Rahner, etc.).
- Sketch the structural schema
  - Add a paragraph (and maybe a simple figure later) that presents the Whole–slice–pattern–attention–update loop as a dynamical system.

1.5 Stage 1 core sources to actually use first
---------------------------------------------

Goal for this phase: keep the stack small and deep. These are the ones to read carefully, take notes on, and explicitly weave into the first complete pass of the paper.

1. Metaphysics of the Whole / process
-------------------------------------
- `whitehead1978process` — anchor for a dynamic, internally-related Whole; use for the claim that reality is processual, relational, and non-atomistic.
- (Add later) A short, secondary intro to process theology (e.g. Cobb or Griffin) if we need clearer theological language than Whitehead himself.

2. Systems, cognition, and constraints
--------------------------------------
- `friston2010free` — core reference for active inference / free-energy; use to justify talk of constraints, prediction, and agents as bounded inference machines.
- `wolfram2002nks` — background for simple rules → complex patterns and global “Whole-like” behavior from local updates.
- `wolfram2021ruliad` — optional but useful as an analogy for a single underlying Whole explored from many computational “slices”.

3. Christian theology and the Trinity
-------------------------------------
- `augustine1991trinity` — classic psychological/relational model of the Trinity; cite when discussing analogies for one reality, three self-relations.
- `rahner1997trinity` — key for “the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity”; use directly when arguing that the way the Whole shows up as Christ/Spirit discloses its inner life.
- `athanasius2011incarnation` — anchor for Christ as concrete historical incarnation; use when connecting the abstract “Christ-pattern” to Jesus of Nazareth.
- `wright1996jesus` — historical-Jesus grounding; use when talking about Christ under real constraint, political pressure, and death.

4. Nondual comparison partners
------------------------------
- `vivekanandajnana` — Vedantic articulation of one reality appearing as many; use as a comparative foil for “Whole and slice”.
- `sarvapriyananda2020advaita` — contemporary, accessible Advaita; helpful when clarifying where the framework agrees with and departs from classical nondualism.

5. Human person, pattern, and consciousness (to add soon)
---------------------------------------------------------
- Add an analytic idealist or consciousness-source (e.g. Bernardo Kastrup) as a dialogue partner on “one mind, many alters”.
- Add one integrated information theory or related systems-consciousness paper if we decide to lean on formal measures of coherence.

1.6 Source-specific notes tracking
----------------------------------
- `friston2010free` — detailed notes in `notes/friston2010-free-energy-notes.txt`; use as the main technical reference for:
  - constraints and agents as self-organizing systems,
  - pattern source as generative model/recognition density,
  - attention as precision/active inference,
  - a naturalistic backbone for the value gradient discussion.
- Whitehead SEP article — detailed notes in `notes/whitehead-sep-notes.txt`; use to:
  - ground our process/relational metaphysics historically,
  - back the rejection of simple location and atomistic materialism,
  - connect our “Whole and slice” ontology to Whitehead’s process metaphysics while clarifying differences.
- Athanasius, *On the Incarnation* — detailed notes in `notes/athanasius-on-incarnation-notes.txt`; use to:
  - anchor the Christ-pattern and Trinity mapping in classic Nicene Christology,
  - preserve creation-through-the-Word and incarnation-for-salvation as core commitments,
  - guard against over-abstracting Christ into a mere alignment archetype.
- Swami Vivekananda, *Jnana Yoga* — detailed notes in `notes/vivekananda-jnana-yoga-notes.txt`; use to:
  - represent Advaita Vedanta / nondualism as a primary comparison class,
  - clarify agreements (one reality, misidentification) and deep differences (world, history, Christ, personal God),
  - inform the “nondual comparison” parts of `paper/main.tex` without collapsing distinctions.
- Sadananda’s *Vedāntasāra* and Sarvapriyananda’s talk — detailed notes in `notes/vedantasara-of-sadananda-notes.txt` and `notes/vedantasara-sarvapriyananda-talk-notes.txt`; use to:
  - see how Advaita systematizes its ontology as precise definitions,
  - model our own “essence of the framework” section structurally,
  - ground comparisons with Advaita beyond popular-level summaries.
- CSB Pew Bible — detailed notes in `notes/csb-bible-notes.txt`; use as:
  - the default English Scripture translation for quotations,
  - a clearly documented textual base when tying the ontology to specific biblical passages.

2. Later stages (sketch only)
-----------------------------
- Stage 2 — Ethical, experiential, and institutional elaboration
  - Work out implications for virtue, trauma, spiritual practice, community, and institutional/technological design.
- Stage 3 — Empirical and formal connections
  - Sharpen links to specific formalisms (IIT, active inference models, non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and possible phenomenological/empirical studies.
