Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Primary nondual comparison partner for Stage 1.
- Clarifies:
  - classical Advaita Vedanta’s claim that **Brahman alone is real**, the world is ultimately **Māyā** (appearance), and the true Self (**Ātman**) is identical with Brahman;
  - the path of **knowledge** (Jnana Yoga): discrimination, disidentification, and direct realization of nonduality.
- For us:
  - provides a sharp foil for our “Whole and slice” ontology, which is similarly monistic but keeps a stronger, value-laden account of creation, history, and Christ.
  - helps articulate where we agree with nondualism (one reality, misidentification as root problem) and where we diverge (status of world, personhood, love, Christ).

Core themes of *Jnana Yoga*
---------------------------
1. Four yogas, Jnana’s place
   - Vivekananda presents four main yogas:
     - **Karma Yoga** – path of selfless action.
     - **Bhakti Yoga** – path of devotion and love.
     - **Raja Yoga** – path of meditation and mind-control.
     - **Jnana Yoga** – path of knowledge, discrimination.
   - Jnana is the most direct but also the most demanding; not a beginner’s path.

2. Real nature of the Self
   - Fundamental Advaitic claim:
     - Our true nature is **Ātman**, pure consciousness, beyond body, mind, and ego.
     - Ātman is **identical with Brahman** (the absolute, nondual reality).
   - What we ordinarily take ourselves to be (body, mind, personality, roles) is a misidentification:
     - “We are not the body, not the mind, not the senses; we are the witness.”
   - Liberation (moksha) is recognizing, realizing, and stabilizing in this truth.

3. Ignorance (Avidyā) and Māyā
   - Cause of bondage:
     - **Avidyā** – beginningless ignorance of our true nature.
   - **Māyā**:
     - the power that makes the One appear as many;
     - manifests as the world of names and forms, which is empirically real but ultimately unreal (relative reality).
   - The world is not evil per se, but:
     - taking it as ultimately real and clinging to it leads to suffering.

4. Discrimination (Viveka) and dispassion (Vairāgya)
   - Key qualifications for Jnana Yoga:
     - **Viveka** – discrimination between the real (Brahman) and the unreal (names and forms).
     - **Vairāgya** – dispassion toward transient objects and experiences.
     - Additional virtues (shatsampatti, etc.): self-control, endurance, faith, concentration.
   - Practice:
     - constant inquiry: “Who am I?” “What is real and unchanging here?”
     - systematically letting go of identifications with body, mind, emotions, social identity.

5. Neti Neti (“Not this, not this”)
   - Method:
     - negate all that is changing, limited, and objectifiable:
       - “I am not the body, not the prana, not the mind, not the intellect, not the ego…”
     - whatever can be observed or known is not the ultimate subject.
   - What remains:
     - pure witnessing consciousness, which is identical with Brahman.

6. God, world, and personal deities
   - At Advaita’s highest level:
     - **nirguṇa Brahman** – impersonal, attribute-less absolute.
   - Personal God (**Īśvara**) and deities are:
     - relative, provisional forms helpful for devotion and practice;
     - ultimately resolved into nondual Brahman in Jnana realization.
   - There is no final, irreducible distinction between God and soul; difference is only apparent and due to ignorance.

7. Ethics and compassion in Jnana Yoga
   - Even in nondual knowledge, ethics matter because:
     - seeing all beings as Self transforms how you act.
   - Compassion arises naturally:
     - harming others is harming oneself (all is Self).
   - But ultimate emphasis is on **knowledge**, not on irreversible historical acts of God (as in Christology).

Connections to Wholeframe concepts
----------------------------------
1. Whole and slice vs Brahman and Jiva
   - Strong resonance:
     - Brahman ↔ Whole as undivided reality.
     - Jiva (individual soul) ↔ Whole-as-slice (Whole under constraints).
   - Difference:
     - Advaita tends to see the individual as ultimately **illusory** (no real, enduring difference at the highest level).
     - Wholeframe treats slices as real **modes of appearance** of the Whole, with their patterning permanently mattering to the Whole’s configuration.

2. Ignorance vs misalignment
   - Advaita:
     - root problem = **ignorance of true nature** (Avidyā).
   - Wholeframe:
     - combines:
       - ignorance / misperception (pattern-source distortions),
       - **misalignment of aim** relative to the Whole’s lean (value gradient).
   - We can say:
     - ignorance in our system = not seeing oneself as Whole-under-constraints;
     - misalignment = actively aiming against the Whole’s lean (destructive randomness).

3. Attention and discrimination
   - Jnana Yoga’s **Viveka** and **Neti Neti** are forms of disciplined attention:
     - repeatedly bringing awareness back to the witnessing Self,
     - withdrawing attention from transient identifications.
   - Wholeframe:
     - attention is “the Whole’s movement through your slice.”
     - Jnana-style practices become:
       - ways of steering attention away from false identifications and toward deeper coherence.

4. World, value, and lean
   - Advaita:
     - world of names and forms is relatively real but ultimately sublated in Brahman.
     - emphasis on transcendence of world.
   - Wholeframe:
     - world and history have **positive, enduring significance**:
       - patterns formed in lives are “written into the Whole’s weights.”
     - the Whole has a **lean** toward coherence, love, and self-giving order.
   - We diverge here:
     - we do not treat the world as ultimately negated;
     - we emphasize a value-laden creative process, not merely illusion to be seen through.

5. Christ and personal God vs nirguṇa Brahman
   - Jnana Yoga’s highest ideal:
     - impersonal Brahman; personal God is provisional.
   - Wholeframe:
     - **Christ** as the decisive self-disclosure of the Whole’s nature under constraints;
     - Trinity (Father/Whole, Son/Form, Spirit/Attention) as structurally real, not merely provisional.
   - Dialogue point:
     - we can acknowledge Jnana’s insight into the nondual ground,
     - but insist that the Whole is not less than personal, self-giving love as revealed in Christ.

How to use *Jnana Yoga* in `paper/main.tex`
-------------------------------------------
- Early ontology sections:
  - Briefly compare:
    - Brahman/Ātman identity with our Whole/slice language.
    - Avidyā with pattern-source ignorance.
  - Emphasize:
    - we share the insight that “self” is not a separate substance, but differ on the status of world and history.
- Comparative section (nondual traditions):
  - Use Vivekananda as the main Advaita voice when:
    - summarizing nondual claims about one reality,
    - articulating the path of knowledge and disidentification.
  - Then contrast:
    - our Christ-centered, value-gradient ontology,
    - our strong affirmation of creation, embodiment, and history.

Open questions / cautions for our project
-----------------------------------------
- Avoid shallow syncretism:
  - Jnana Yoga is **not** just “same as” Christian contemplation.
  - Be explicit about deep differences:
    - personhood, love, cross/resurrection, and judgment.
- Clarity about “illusion” vs “training run”:
  - For us, lives are training runs whose patterns permanently matter;
  - for Advaita, ultimate realization often devalues historical particularity.
  - We should articulate this difference clearly when we use Vivekananda as a dialogue partner.
