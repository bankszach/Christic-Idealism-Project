Title
-----
- Sadananda Yogindra, *Vedāntasāra* (“Essence of Vedanta”).
- Local reference: `The-vedantasara-of-sadana.txt` (scanned/partial Sanskrit text with commentary).

Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Classical Advaita Vedanta **primer** (prakarana) that systematizes the core nondual framework:
  - definitions of Brahman, Īśvara, jīva, Māyā, ignorance, liberation;
  - structure of person (bodies, sheaths, states);
  - qualifications and method for Jnana (knowledge) practice.
- For us:
  - provides a clean, technical template for **ontology via definitions** that we can parallel (Whole, slice, constraints, pattern source, attention, lean, evil).
  - shows how a mature tradition packs an entire metaphysics into a small, teachable text—useful structural model for our own “essence of the Wholeframe” exposition.

Core content (standard structure of Vedāntasāra)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Authority and purpose
   - Vedanta’s basis:
     - Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Brahma Sutras (śruti + smṛti + nyāya).
   - Purpose of *Vedāntasāra*:
     - to present the essence of Advaita Vedanta in a concise and systematic form for students.

2. Qualifications (sādhana-catuṣṭaya)
   - Fourfold discipline required for effective Vedanta study:
     - **Viveka** – discrimination between eternal (nitya) and non-eternal (anitya).
     - **Vairāgya** – dispassion towards enjoyments here and hereafter.
     - **Śamādi-ṣaṭka-sampatti** – six virtues: śama, dama, uparati, titikṣā, śraddhā, samādhāna.
     - **Mumukṣutva** – intense desire for liberation.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - good template for our own account of what inner posture/aim is needed for deep alignment and pattern-source transformation.

3. Means of knowledge (pramāṇa) and Vedantic method
   - Outlines three primary means:
     - perception (pratyakṣa),
     - inference (anumāna),
     - scripture/testimony (śabda).
   - Knowledge of Brahman/Ātman ultimately depends on **śruti** as primary means, aided by reason and experience.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - helps us articulate how we treat:
       - experience, science, and revelation/theology as different types of evidence for the Whole.

4. Structure of the person: bodies and sheaths
   - Three bodies:
     - **Sthūla śarīra** – gross/physical body.
     - **Sūkṣma śarīra** – subtle/psychic body (mind, senses, prāṇa).
     - **Kāraṇa śarīra** – causal body (ignorance/seed state).
   - Five sheaths (pañca kośa):
     - annamaya (physical food sheath),
     - prāṇamaya (vital sheath),
     - manomaya (mental),
     - vijñānamaya (intellect),
     - ānandamaya (bliss/causal).
   - For Wholeframe:
     - a rich template for how to talk about **constraints** and **pattern source** across layers (bodily, affective, cognitive, deep causal).

5. States of consciousness and the Self
   - Waking (jāgrat), dream (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), and **Turiya** (the ever-present witnessing awareness).
   - Shows:
     - body and mind are changing appearances across states;
     - the witnessing Self is constant.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - maps onto our “Whole-as-you” vs changing slice-interface states;
     - supports our claim that the “real self” is deeper than the story-self.

6. Māyā, superimposition (adhyāsa), and error
   - **Māyā**:
     - indescribable (anirvacanīya), neither real nor unreal, dependent on Brahman;
     - power that projects names and forms.
   - **Adhyāsa**:
     - superimposition of body/mind attributes onto the Self, and vice versa.
   - Root problem:
     - mistaking the non-self (anātman) for the Self and taking the world as ultimately real.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - we can reinterpret:
       - Māyā as the slice’s **constraint and generative structure** that yields a limited world-model;
       - adhyāsa as pattern-source misalignment and misidentification.

7. Jīva, Īśvara, Brahman
   - **Brahman**:
     - pure consciousness, existence-knowledge-bliss (sat–cit–ānanda), nondual.
   - **Īśvara**:
     - Brahman reflected in Māyā; Lord, controller, omniscient, cause of the universe.
   - **Jīva**:
     - Brahman reflected in the subtle body; individual experiencer.
   - Relationship:
     - essentially nondual (same Brahman),
     - apparently different due to upādhis (limiting adjuncts).
   - For Wholeframe:
     - strong resonance with:
       - Whole as ground (Father),
       - Whole as form and Lord (Christ / Son),
       - Whole as attention and guidance (Spirit),
       - slices as constrained reflections of the Whole.

8. Knowledge, practice, and liberation
   - Process:
     - **śravaṇa** – listening to teachings of nonduality.
     - **manana** – reflecting to remove doubts.
     - **nididhyāsana** – deep meditation/assimilation.
   - Liberation (mokṣa):
     - knowledge of identity of Ātman and Brahman,
     - destruction of ignorance (not necessarily immediate destruction of prārabdha karma).
   - Jīvanmukti vs videhamukti:
     - living liberation while body remains vs after death.
   - For Wholeframe:
     - provides a mature pattern for:
       - how **attention + pattern source** are reconfigured through repeated exposure, reflection, and contemplative stabilization.

Connections to Wholeframe work
------------------------------
- Definitions-as-ontology:
  - Vedāntasāra shows how to build a whole system around tight, recursive definitions.
  - Our project can mirror this by giving crisp definitions of Whole, slice, constraints, pattern source, attention, lean, aim, alignment, evil.
- Comparative nondualism:
  - Vedāntasāra anchors our engagement with Advaita at a technical level, beyond popular summaries.
  - We can position:
    - our agreement: one underlying reality, misidentification as root problem;
    - our divergence: enduring value of history, Christ-specific self-disclosure, strong moral/relational lean.

How to use this source
----------------------
- Treat as:
  - structural inspiration for our own “essence of the framework” section.
  - background reference for any precise comparisons with Advaita Vedanta beyond Vivekananda’s expositions.
- In `paper/main.tex`:
  - mention *Vedāntasāra* in the comparative section as a canonical Advaita primer.
  - do not overload the paper with technical details from it—Stage 1 aim is clarity, not full Vedānta technicality.
