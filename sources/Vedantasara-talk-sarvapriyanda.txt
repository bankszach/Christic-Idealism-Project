0:29
So welcome back to this new session of the Vedanta study group.
0:35
This session we are going to start with this text Vedanta Sara of Sadananda Yogindra.
0:44
This is the translation by Swami Nikhilananda and I have given you a PDF of the text.
0:51
You should have received it with the email in which you got the link so you can have
0:57
the PDF on on your computer just for reference. If you don't have the book, it's much better to have the book
1:04
so that you can follow along with it. Now, what is this text and what are we doing?
1:12
The whole purpose of the Vedanta study group was to have an advanced study group where you could study
1:17
the original texts sources of Vedanta in some depth.
1:24
So we have done various kinds of texts we have in Hollywood.
1:30
I did the Drig Drishya Viveka and then we did the Aparoksha Anubhuti that was in general for everybody but in the Vedanta study group we
1:39
at one time we did a little bit of the Panchadashi and recently we have been doing the Mandukya Upanishad.
1:49
The fundamental texts of Advaita Vedanta, the fundamental texts of
1:58
Advaita Vedanta are the Upanishads. The In fact Vedanta itself is the Upanishads are collectively known as Vedanta.
2:10
That's one definition of Vedanta and the wisdom of the Upanishads was given out in a practical form by Krishna to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita.
2:19
So that has also become one of the fundamental texts of Vedanta and the third pillar, think of it as a tripod with three legs.
2:28
So no that's not a good example because the Upanishads are not just like one leg. It is the base.
2:34
It's a fundamental. The Bhagavad Gita is actually derivative from the Upanishads and one more derivative text is the Brahma Sutras which discuss
2:42
philosophical and textual issues arising out of a study of the Upanishads.
2:48
Anyway the point being that if you want to know what is the textual basis of the Vedanta as a whole it will be
2:54
these three texts or groups of texts. The Upanishads are a group of texts that is Vedanta fundamentally and
3:02
the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutra along with the commentaries written by
3:09
the great masters of Vedanta like Adi Shankaracharya. Depending on the commentaries different schools of Vedanta have come out
3:15
and we are studying one school. Our primary school is the Abhidvaita Vedanta, non-dual Vedanta.
3:21
That's what we study. That's what I teach. Now a lot of other texts were written.
3:27
These later texts are often classified as Prakarana. There is no easy translation of that.
3:35
Prakarana literally is usually translated as an introductory text. Though some of these texts are not at all introductory.
3:41
They are pretty advanced. But they all teach the same thing as the Upanishads do.
3:47
The text which we are going to take up is one such Prakarana, the Vedanta Sara.
3:52
It is actually an introductory text. Why are we doing this?
4:02
See my idea was to study the Upanishads together and I decided to start at
4:07
the top. Begin with the end. The most powerful, the most direct, the most powerful, the most compact
4:15
of the Upanishads, the Mandukya Upanishad along with Gaurapada's Karikas, which we successfully, by the grace of God, we studied it and it is complete
4:24
and it is available as podcasts, free to download from the internet.
4:32
So that's done. But that is not the way it is usually studied.
4:38
Nobody starts out with the Mandukya generally. It is more my ambition than anything else.
4:44
It's more for my own sake than for the sake of the students. But having done that, now we can take the scenic route.
4:52
We can take our time and do it slowly and the way it is supposed to be done. So what one would do is go through the major Upanishads.
5:01
The major Upanishads being the Upanishads selected by Adi Shankaracharya
5:07
to write commentaries on Bhashya. Bhashya means commentary. So he did it for 10 Upanishads and arguably an 11th one.
5:15
The 10 Upanishads being the Isha, Kena, Katha, Mundaka, Mandukya, Aitareya,
5:24
Taittiriya, the Prashna Upanishad, the Chandogya and the Brihadaranyaka.
5:32
Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Munda, Mandukya, Tittiri, Aitareyam,
5:38
Chandogyam, Brihadaranyakam Tatha. So the little Sanskrit verse which gives you the whole syllabus.
5:43
So these are 10 Upanishads which we now call major Upanishads.
5:49
And the 11th which is, which might be Shankaracharya's commentary on which has comes with Shankaracharya's commentary
5:55
is the Shwetashwathara. But it is doubted by scholars both traditional and modern
6:02
whether Shankaracharya actually wrote that commentary or it was
6:07
some later Shankaracharya, not the original one. Anyway, so that should be the syllabus.
6:15
But what I thought was before we plunge ahead and take the long scenic route through the Upanishads themselves,
6:24
it would be helpful to do one more introductory text. Why do I say one more?
6:30
Because we have done the Dhrig Drishya Viveka which is introductory text like this. We have done the Aparokshanubhuti which is another introductory text like this.
6:37
But, the merit of this text is this is where traditional Vedanta students start.
6:44
For example, when we were novices in our main monastery at Belur Math, which Prakhyat has at his background.
6:51
So when we were novices there, we were introduced to Vedanta, always Advaita Vedanta, through this text.
6:58
So in the first year of our studies, we would study this text and of course make an entry into everything else.
7:05
So why did I not start with this text and why did I start with Dhrig Drishya Viveka and Aparokshanubhuti?
7:11
Well, frankly for advertisement purposes, Drig Drishya Viveka and Aparokshanubhuti
7:18
are interesting, racy, things are happening. Drig Drishya Viveka opens with a bang.
7:23
The first verse itself is tremendous and Aparoksha Nubhuti is also very, very interesting.
7:28
So is this going to be a dull journey? Not really. The only problem with this text is it is actually, it's very useful,
7:35
but it's useful precisely because it's a book of definitions. You'll be surprised at the elegance and precision,
7:42
definition of what is Brahman, what is God, what is the absolute, what are we sentient beings, define it precisely so that we don't have to quarrel
7:51
about what we are talking about later on. It's all precisely defined, even Maya, most difficult of all,
7:57
all of it precisely defined and laid out for us. So, and it's a wonderful sketch of the entire Advaita Vedanta philosophy.
8:08
So this is where we start. Now, a monk who is a highly trained scholar, does not,
8:16
told me once that you should never do these things, like start with a book like this, because he says one should always go to the originals.
8:24
He said that we were always taught in our university by our professors that we should always go straight to the originals.
8:30
That has merit. The problem with starting with a text like this is, remember this text comes around 15th century.
8:39
So about 500, 600 years ago, but three or 4,000 years after the originals,
8:46
the Upanishads, which it purports to summarize and explain. So what this text does is it's a highly systematized exposition,
8:55
very elegant, very neat, easy to understand, easy to base yourself
9:00
on, but always good to remember that this is not the original. A lot of philosophizing has gone on for thousands of years, literally before this,
9:11
and especially after Shankaracharya for about 800 years before this text comes along.
9:16
So a lot of argumentation, a lot of back and forth until a system is established.
9:23
But a system, like any system, has the advantage of being neat and geometric, but also a few steps removed from the truth.
9:31
It's good for our intellect. It's easily digestible, but it somehow does not totally,
9:41
accurately, faithfully represent the vibrancy, the aliveness of the originals.
9:48
It's more like a map and not the actual place you want to visit. So this is the demerit.
9:56
But then what is the merit of studying this? See, if you are a university scholar, you would do what that scholarly monk told me,
10:03
that you go to the original text straight away. But, they would do that because the whole purpose
10:10
is to study the original text. That's the whole purpose. Our whole purpose as a spiritual seekers is does not end with
10:17
studying the original text. It's actually to understand this system, to practice it,
10:23
and to realize it in our lives. So if there are books which help us out, most welcome.
10:29
Most welcome. We just should have that buyer beware that we are looking at Advaita Vedanta
10:36
through the lens of a very, of a late philosopher
10:42
in the Advaita tradition. It's through a particular lens. It's a particular systematization. It's for, it's like a textbook for students.
10:51
So that's what's going on here. So having said that, a little bit about, um, just a minute, yeah.
11:04
So a little bit about the author, Sadananda Yogindra was a monk about, um,
11:12
maybe, you know, uh, 600 years ago.
11:20
And this book, since he wrote it, he wrote it for, for students who want
11:25
an introduction into the philosophical system of Advaita Vedanta. Um, uh, since that time, traditional Vedantic scholars
11:37
have been introduced to Advaita Vedanta through this book. Um, as I said, in our monastery, when we studied Vedanta systematically,
11:45
we were introduced to it through this book. So we're going to do this. Um, it's a short text.
11:51
In fact, recently I taught it at the Vivekananda Vidya Pith
11:57
in Wayne, New Jersey. So, and I have been teaching it. I, I was the teacher, the Acharya who taught this text
12:05
at the training center for the Brahmacharis, for the newcomers, the novices, for several years, I think five or six years.
12:12
I taught this one after another. I taught it one cycle. I taught it at Hollywood also. So I've been doing this for a long time.
12:20
Um, yes. What else did I want to say?
12:25
Sometimes I usually require a blackboard or something to write on. So since we don't have that here, I'll make this little, quite unimpressive,
12:35
um, PowerPoints to share with you. So here goes, little bit of information.
12:45
How do we do this? Share screen.
12:54
Okay. Can you see the PowerPoint? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Let me just maximize it now.
13:07
Okay. As I said, it's a 15th century text. Sadananda Yogindra wrote it.
13:13
Um, there have been multiple commentaries on this because it's so much so popular so popular over
13:19
the centuries and has been in use. So three commentaries.
13:24
So this is an introductory text, but, uh, there are commentaries on this text, nothing that we need to be concerned with, but I'll be explaining the text
13:33
and you might at some point wonder where, where am I getting all this? So some of it is drawn from these traditional commentaries.
13:40
The first commentary is called the Vidyvanmanoranjini written by another monk Rama Tirtha sometime after Sadananda Yogindra.
13:49
Literally the word Vidyvanmanoranjini means the delight of scholars. So the commentary itself is called the delight of scholars
13:58
and you can imagine it, the commentary is more difficult than the original. The next one is by another monk called Nrusimha Saraswati.
14:08
And that commentary is called the Subodhini, literally, which means easily understood and which is more difficult
14:15
than the earlier commentary. uh, and the last one, which I'll be relying on a little bit more for this, this time
14:22
around teaching was by another Sanskrit, another philosopher Apo Deva,
14:29
which is called Balabodhini, which is the most difficult of them all.
14:35
And it means, wait for it, easily understood by children. Balabodhini for the easy instruction of little children.
14:44
So why would, just as a matter of curiosity, why would one write complictaed
14:51
um commentaries for what is meant to be a textbook? What these commentaries actually do is they fill in the, this book is
14:59
a bare bones outline of Advaita Vedanta. But if you want the details, you go to the commentaries
15:04
and they provide you explanations, arguments, and so on and so forth. Anyway, we won't be seeing any of this too much.
15:12
It'll be in the background when I'm explaining stuff. Okay. That's it.
15:18
Now let's start the text.
15:24
Use the PDF I've shared with you. This text and the PDF are not the same. The PDF is the original Sanskrit with the English transliteration.
15:34
It's the advantage of having the English transliteration. So you can follow the chant, if you like, with an English translation
15:39
made by one of our Swamis. It was never published as a book. This is the book available on the market, Vedanta sara of Sadananda, translated by
15:47
Swami Nikhilananda of our East Sides Center. It's very easily available on YouTube, sorry, not on YouTube,
15:56
on Amazon, on the Vedanta Press. I think just four or five dollars.
16:02
It's inexpensive. I recommend that you order it. I had sent out the links. If you got that email, you will find links where you can order this book.
16:11
Some of you already have it. So today I will, I'll make a beginning.
16:18
We shall start the text today. And just as always, Prakhyat, this time is our, our coordinator.
16:25
Just as always, he'll keep a lookout for people coming in, for people raising
16:30
their hands in questions. As we go along, raise your hands or write a question in the chat.
16:36
we will stop once in a while to deal with the questions and have a little discussion.
16:42
So let's make a beginning. This is Vedanta Sara. The beginning in the, the first verse, the first two verses are invocations.
16:54
Let me share just for today. I'll share the PDF, but otherwise you can look at it
17:03
on your, on your own screens. This is a little cumbersome.
17:15
Can you see the PDF? Can you see the PDF? Yes. Yes. Right.
17:20
So we're going to do the first verse now. The first two verses are invocations.
17:26
First verse. Akhandam Sacchidanandam avaang-manasa gocharam; aatmaanam akhiladharam aashraye abhishta siddhaye
17:43
What does it mean? I take refuge in the self, the indivisible existence, consciousness,
17:50
bliss absolute beyond the reach of words and thought, the substratum of all for the attainment of my cherished desire.
17:57
Okay. So what's happening here?
18:04
Invocation. It was the style in Sanskrit text to start with an invocation. Usually it was in a prayer to God or in praise of one's guru.
18:15
That it was just the way the text started. Now, why would one do that?
18:22
um among the traditional Hindu philosophies is the Nyaya system. They are the logicians.
18:29
And if you think Vedanta is complicated or too theoretical, you should try some Nyaya text. For example, a Nyaya text would start, they have an introductory text just
18:37
like this to start the Nyaya system, which is called Tarka Sangraha, which means literally it means a collection of arguments.
18:44
So that also starts with an invocation, but here we proceed along merrily,
18:49
but in the Nyaya text, you cannot. Everything is to be questioned. So the moment there's an invocation, the question is raised,
18:55
why is there an invocation? What are you doing? Why are you praying to God or guru or whatever it is?
19:02
And the answer given there is for the overcoming of obstacles
19:08
and the successful completion of the text. So the author is praying for overcoming all obstacles to the project of writing
19:17
the book maybe, and so that the text is completed. Maybe it gets good reviews and the wide circulation down the ages,
19:24
which I think invocation did succeed. We are still studying it now in Manhattan in the 21st century.
19:33
So in Sanskrit, Vigna Nivaranartham, to overcome obstacles and Grantha Samapti,
19:41
Parisamapti Artham, for successful completion of the text. For the students who are studying it, it just might mean overcoming
19:48
the obstacles for our study and completing the text.
19:54
So that's why we do it. So the questioner will not let go. Immediately, there'll be further questions.
20:02
But wait, we know of so many examples where books are written without
20:09
any invocation and they are happily completed. I'm sure today, especially if you go to Barnes and Noble and pick out books
20:16
at random, you'll hardly find a book with an invocation to God or guru. And they are all completed.
20:22
They are on the shelves of Barnes and Noble. So how can you say an invocation helps in completing the text?
20:28
One. Two, we also know of many texts, this is the question, the doubt.
20:33
We also know of many texts which have beautiful invocations in the finest Sanskrit and were never completed.
20:41
Maybe the author abandoned it halfway or maybe it's lost or something like that. So what do you say to that?
20:47
You know, the argument is invocation helps you to complete the text. And the counter argument is there are many texts without any invocations,
20:54
nicely completed. And there are many texts with invocations we've never completed.
20:59
And the reply to this is, I'm giving you a taste of how the Nyaya people do things, not us Vedantins.
21:05
Thankfully, we have spared all that. The answer from the Nyaya philosopher is that, well, in the case of the books
21:15
which are completed without invocation, the author had lots of good karma in the past life. He must have done lots of invocations in the past life.
21:22
So his good karma carries over and his new book is completed without an invocation. And in the case of books which were which had invocations
21:30
but were not completed, well, obviously, karma was really bad. And so it needed more invocations.
21:36
And that's why due to lack of sufficient invocation, the book was not completed. And they go on like this.
21:43
But you might think, this is, what's the point of this kind of argumentation?
21:49
But the ultimate result which they came to, the Nyaya philosophers, and which is why I raised this topic at all, it's pretty reasonable.
21:58
They come to the conclusion that the invocation is just a matter of culture.
22:03
If you are a cultured person in this kind of an environment, this kind of a setup, you start any important task with a prayer to God, with an acknowledgement
22:14
of your Guru's contributions. And that's just being cultured.
22:20
Shishta, they call it shishta in Sanskrit, a cultured person. It's a mark of a cultured person.
22:25
Another question comes up. So it's good. Why are you doing it aloud? You could do it in your mind.
22:31
And the answer would be shishya shikshartham for teaching students.
22:38
So if the teacher does an invocation in his or her mind and goes ahead, how will the students learn unless you do it and you write it
22:45
down and you chant it together? So this is the way these arguments go.
22:51
But anyway, we have an invocation here. Now let me get into the invocation.
22:56
The two invocations, first and second, the second one will be about the Guru. The first one is about Brahman or the ultimate reality.
23:04
In this one verse, the first verse itself, the author Sadananda basically covers
23:10
the entire teaching of the Advaita Vedanta system in substance, in essence.
23:18
What is he saying?
23:24
I salute or I take refuge in, ashraya, I take refuge in that ultimate reality,
23:31
which is akhandam. The word akhandam means non-divided. Khandam means divided, different.
23:37
Akhandam, undivided, non-different. Akhandam, sachchidanandam, existence, consciousness, bliss.
23:47
So let us stop here and see what it means. The ultimate reality, according to Vedanta, is devoid of any difference.
23:56
There is no difference. There is no division.
24:01
Now, division or difference is the basis of our day-to-day life.
24:07
Right here, I and you, we are different. It seems quite obvious.
24:13
I'm in a different place. You're in a different place. I'm different from the instrument, the computer I'm using.
24:22
Your computer is different from my computer. And this whole, if you look around the room, you'll find so many differences.
24:29
Doors and windows and lights and fans and dogs and cats and men
24:36
and women, space and solid and liquid. So much difference all around seems to be full of difference.
24:45
To get a handle on differences, what kinds of difference are there? So in Vedanta, they talk about three kinds of differences.
24:53
All differences may be classified under three kinds. The three kinds of differences are, difference in Sanskrit is bheda.
25:02
Bheda means different. You know, Swami, abhedananda. Abheda means non-different.
25:08
Bheda, different. Abheda, non-different. So one whose bliss is in the non-different, abhedananda,
25:14
whose bliss is in Brahman, which is non-different. Anyway, so bheda, difference, is of three kinds,
25:21
according to advaita vedanta what are the three kinds? vijatiya bheda, um sajatiya bheda, swagata bheda
25:29
Let me put it on the screen and then you can take a look.
25:36
Where did it go? Yes. um
25:44
One second. What happened?um
26:01
Are you able to see the presentation? No. No, Swami.
26:06
One second. Yes. Now I can share.
26:15
Technology is great, but it sometimes can be an impediment to learning.
26:24
Okay. Now you can see it. Yes. Three kinds of bheda, difference.
26:31
So what are these three kinds of difference? Vijatiya bheda, difference of kind.
26:38
So for example, trees and rocks and animals and birds, they're all different kinds of, you know, things of species, of classes.
26:46
So these are vijatiya, different kinds of things. Brahman, the ultimate reality, does not have this kind of difference.
26:55
It's a tremendous claim. What does it mean? There is nothing apart from Brahman.
27:04
So vijatiya difference means there are other kinds of things. So I'm a human being, you're all human beings,
27:10
but there are other kinds of things. There's the chairs we are sitting on, there are the computers we are using,
27:15
there are different kinds of things from us. So Brahman does not, there's nothing that exists,
27:21
which is different from Brahman. Vijatiya bheda means there is no non-Brahman in this world,
27:27
which is a huge, huge claim, which we shall explore through the text slowly.
27:33
But it just means all that we see is in some sense, it must be Brahman.
27:40
And in the sense we take it to be, we take it to be, here is a computer, here is a person, here is a light, here is a table.
27:48
That's that. The moment we say that's that, Vedanta is saying it's wrong.
27:53
If you think it is just people and tables and chairs, then what you think are just people and tables and chairs,
28:00
they are appearances. They cannot be real. They are, actually, they have to be nothing other
28:07
than Brahman. This is the claim. We'll see how it makes perfect sense. Now it seems crazy. We don't see Brahman anywhere.
28:13
And here the claim is that there is nothing apart from Brahman. We see everything except your precious Brahman.
28:20
And the Vedanta is claiming Brahman is the only thing that there is, and there is nothing different from Brahman.
28:27
So Vijatiya bheda is difference of kind, just as trees and rocks and different animals are different kinds of things.
28:33
The second kind of difference is they are different, but of the same kind. So the question might be, like a polytheist might ask, yes,
28:43
God exists, but there may be many gods.
28:48
So you're right. It may be that there is only Brahman. There's nothing other than Brahman, but there could be more than one Brahman.
28:56
So it's still Brahman, nothing other than Brahman, but several Brahmans. So an example of this kind of system might be the Sankhya system,
29:05
where we are all pure consciousness. We are Purusha, pure consciousness, but each of us is a separate pure consciousness.
29:11
There are multiple pure consciousnesses. And Vedanta says, no, not even that.
29:19
Different of the same kind example is two mango trees. So in the first example, it could be a mango tree and a rock
29:25
and maybe an elephant. They're different.
29:31
But Sajatiya bheda is two mango trees. Both are mango trees, but they're not the same. They're two different examples of the same kind of thing.
29:39
In philosophy, this is called a type token difference. Same type, but two tokens of the same type.
29:45
Mango tree, but two mango trees. They're different. Vedanta says, no, there are no two Brahmans or three Brahmans
29:52
or four Brahmans, nothing. There is only one reality. Not even of different Brahmans, the different things of the same kind.
30:00
No, the absolute is one. All right. There might be another kind of difference.
30:06
There are no different kinds of things, not even many things of the same kind. Only one thing.
30:12
I get it. But that one thing could have internal differences. So like a mango tree, it has leaves and roots and a branch and mangoes.
30:23
So the mangoes and the root is not the same thing. The trunk and the branches are not the same thing.
30:29
The leaves and the twigs are not the same thing, although they are all part
30:36
of the same mango tree. So is it possible that Brahman has internal differences?
30:43
So for example, an example would be the system of Vishistha Advaita Vedanta,
30:49
which says there is only one ultimate divine reality, but all of us, we are parts of it.
30:56
And as parts, we are different. There are sentient beings, there are insentient beings, there's a material universe, and we are conscious beings, all conscious beings
31:05
and the entire material universe. They are all part of one organic whole.
31:12
But within that organic whole, there are differences. Brahman is the ultimate reality, but within Brahman, there are differences,
31:21
internal differences. That's Vishistha Advaita. Vedanta see Advaita Vedanta is saying no, not even that.
31:28
There is no internal differentiation. All of it is just pure being, which is not different
31:35
from pure consciousness, which is not different from pure bliss. Sat, Chit, Ananda.
31:40
Is there anything apart from Sachchidananda? Vijatiya bheda, the first kind. Vedanta says no.
31:46
Are there many Sachchidanandas? Plural. Swajatiya bheda, Advaita says no.
31:53
Within Sachchidananda, maybe there are three parts, you know, a Sat part, a Chit, an existence part, a consciousness part, a bliss part.
32:00
Or like Vishnu has multiple hands and a head and a tummy and legs.
32:05
No, none of that, no internal difference. It is one absolute without any internal differences
32:12
and without any kind of anything other than that also. So this is the meaning of the word Akhandam, non-divided.
32:22
So you can see a huge amount is packed into it. What is this non-divided reality?
32:29
So I have this funny little story I usually do not fail to share.
32:35
About 20 years ago, I was in an ashram and the Swami, it is a very big ashram with many units.
32:42
So one of those units, where a lot of work was done for poor kids of the neighborhood, they got a donation from a rich person and the rich person
32:54
wanted a plaque to be put up, you know, and the plaque would say that by the grace
33:00
of Sri Ramakrishna, who is a part of the partless infinite, who came as
33:09
the gracious, by the grace of Sri Ramakrishna, we are able to do this.
33:15
And he is, that rich person promised a certain amount of money. Now in the head of that unit, the monk
33:21
went to our head monk of the ashram. The head monk was furious.
33:28
He said, what? Sri Ramakrishna is a part of the partless Brahman. I will not allow the partless Brahman to be parted.
33:35
And he said, Akhanda, in Bengali, Akhanda, the same word, Akhanda. Brahman is Akhanda, without part.
33:40
Don't you know your basic Vedanta? Haven't you studied Vedanta sara? And he called us, a few of us, we are novices, we are just youngsters.
33:48
You guys read a lot. Tell me, am I right? Or is this person right? Can Akhanda, Brahman, the partless be parted?
33:55
Can Sri Ramakrishna be a part of the partless? And we of course had to say, no, no swami the funniest was, the Swami
34:03
who was receiving the donation, he was standing outside with an ashen face, you know, he said, I don't care if Brahman has parts
34:10
or does not have parts. I just don't want my donation to be parted. I don't want to part with my donation.
34:17
So Akhanda means partless. What is Akhandam? Sat, Chit, Anandam.
34:25
Sat means existence. Chit means consciousness. Ananda means bliss.
34:30
I will not go into that because that will just take up every all the time. We have come become used to this terminology.
34:37
Pure being, pure consciousness, pure bliss. What does it mean in Vivekananda's words?
34:44
It is not that Brahman exists, but it is existence itself. It is not that Brahman knows, but that it is knowledge itself.
34:52
It is not that Brahman is happy, but it is happiness itself.
34:58
Okay. That sounds interesting. Um Let me stop the share.
35:05
Can you all see me now? You can see me? Yes. What does that mean?
35:13
Brahman is not, not that Brahman exists, but it is existence itself.
35:18
The moment we say existence, you know what comes to our minds? Things which exist.
35:25
I exist, you exist, people exist. The chair I'm sitting on exists. The building and even the air, even the space seems to be pretty empty,
35:35
but in some sense it exists. Or more abstract things like numbers or ideas, in some sense they exist.
35:44
So the moment we say existence, we think of things existing,
35:49
but Vedanta is not talking about that. Vedanta is saying that at least conceive of
35:57
existence itself instead of thinking of say waves, think of water.
36:04
There are two ways of thinking of the relation between waves and water. You can think of a wave and it has water in it, but that would be
36:12
a weird way of saying it. Wouldn't you rather say water is appearing as a wave? Yeah, that sounds more logical.
36:18
Water is appearing as a wave. Similarly, Vedanta, what Vedanta wants to say is, can you think of
36:25
existence appearing as chairs and tables?
36:30
Existence is the reality. Being is the reality and it appears as existing things.
36:37
We tend to think things exist. It's like things have existence in them.
36:43
That's a weird way of putting it, but that's what it means. It's like saying a wave has water in it.
36:50
You might ask what's wrong with that? What's wrong is it is like saying like a bucket has water in it,
36:57
a wave has water in it, but wave is nothing apart from water. A bucket can exist without water, can be an empty bucket, but there's
37:03
no such thing as an empty wave. The wave must be water.Similarly,
37:09
when you come to existence, note, nothing can exist without existing.
37:15
It sounds like a silly, tautological statement, but nothing can exist without existence is exactly like saying
37:22
there can be no wave without water. All things exist, which means the Vedantic way of putting it
37:30
would be existence appears as all things. We say our language is not suited to this kind of thinking.
37:38
Our language is very dualistic. We say table exists, chair exists.
37:44
Vedanta would like us to say existence tables or existence chairs,
37:50
murdering the language, but that's how that's what Vedanta is trying to say.
37:56
The reality is existence and it manifests itself or we experience it as existing things.
38:02
When things come into existence, it's not that existence has come into existence. The thing has come into existence and the thing goes out of existence.
38:10
Existence continues. Wave arises in water does not mean water has come into existence.
38:16
The wave has arisen in water, remains in water, dissolves back into water. All things in this universe, they arise in existence, they shine in existence
38:24
and they fade back into existence. Okay. That is to put it in one word, Sat.
38:31
In Sanskrit, Sat, pure being. Chit, I will not go into details in the same pattern.
38:40
Chit is consciousness. When we, the moment we say consciousness, we think of conscious thoughts, feelings,
38:45
emotions, ideas, perceptions, understanding, memory, all of that.
38:50
These are instances of consciousness. They're not consciousness itself.
38:56
Consciousness is experienced in these moments. These are actually movements of the mind which shine in consciousness.
39:03
Consciousness itself is not a thought, feeling, perception, memory, idea,
39:08
none of it, but they all shine in consciousness. And bliss in the same pattern, I'll just leave you with this suggestion.
39:18
Bliss is not a pleasant feeling or an exciting, thrilling experience.
39:23
Bliss is that which is experienced as all kinds of joys of our world. Shankaracharya says that ocean, the spray of which people
39:33
in this world are madly running after. So imagine an ocean of bliss, little droplets
39:38
of which are coming out as spray. And people are madly running after that as the most attainable pleasures
39:44
and joys of this world. So that bliss, which is not a particular kind of pleasure,
39:51
but rather the substratum of all things experienced as pleasant, happy,
39:57
fulfilling, that is called Ananda. And that is Sat Chidananda.
40:02
They are not three different things. They are not three different qualities. It's the same thing.
40:09
This Sachchidananda, he says, avam manasa gojanam, not attainable by not objectifiable by speech or by mind.
40:20
Why not attainable by speech? I will not go into details here. I have given talks about this again and again.
40:26
What can speech do? Speech can talk about things which are, you know, they say, jati, guna,
40:33
kriya, sambandha, rurhi. Those of you, if it rings some bells, you must have heard it at some time.
40:40
If something belongs to a class of objects, like a cow, there's a species of cow. So you see one instance and you say, that is a cow.
40:48
How did you know? Because it belongs to a species which you are invoking. This is an instance of a species.
40:54
So cow, you're using jati. But there is no species of Brahman. There's no species of Sachchidananda.
41:00
There is not a class, a set of Sachchidanandas. So you can say, aha, here's one of them. Here's a Brahman.
41:05
No. So Brahman, you cannot use class or species to refer to Brahman.
41:13
Quality. So red flower. The moment I say red flower, you can pick out the red flower,
41:19
distinguish it from the blue and the violet and the orange and the yellow and bring me the red flower. Because red is a quality which helps you to distinguish that flower.
41:27
You can use a quality to point out an object. But you can't use it for Brahman because Brahman is famously
41:33
without any quality, without any attribute. Absolute is beyond attribute. Quality won't work.
41:39
Action. So, you know, like the cook. Compliment the cook. The dish was delicious.
41:45
How do you know what to do? By the activity. So you designate a person by the activity of cooking or driving or,
41:53
you know, speaking or something. Some activity. You can't do that for Brahman. Brahman has no activity.
41:59
It's beyond all activity. So you can't use Kriya or action. Relation. Um
42:06
Teacher. Makes sense only when they are students. Father. Makes sense only when there's a son or a daughter.
42:13
But Brahman, how will you use relation to designate Brahman? There's nothing. We just learned. There's nothing other than Brahman.
42:20
So with what will Brahman have a relation? So you can't use relation to point to Brahman. And finally, conventional.
42:26
Can't you just do it? You can't just say when you say this person is a Jim.
42:33
So what do you say? Jim. This person is Jim. Not because of some class or quality or action or relationship.
42:40
Just be named this person Jim. So can't be named it. You know, you are using the words Brahman, Atman, something.
42:46
Just name it. Just use a word. You can't do that because to just use a word, it's called
42:52
conventional designation. To just use conventional designation, you have to point out the person.
42:57
You have to say this person is Jim. Unless you do that, you tell me, go call Jim.
43:05
I'll say, who is Jim? I don't know who is Jim. You have to point me out. Point it out.
43:11
When you say this baby from now on will be called Jane. You have to point out this baby, which baby.
43:17
If there are many babies, then we don't, it still won't work. Similarly, to use a name like Brahman or Atman, you have to point it out.
43:26
What is Brahman or Atman? You can't point it out. Therefore, conventional designation won't work.
43:31
The point being, none of the ways in which language functions works for the absolute.
43:37
Unless the absolute is clothed in some name and form and function, you can't use language for it.
43:42
So it says beyond the reach of speech, beyond the reach of mind, because mind itself shines in the light of consciousness.
43:52
And with that consciousness, mind objectifies the world. Mind comprehends the world, but mind itself is illumined by
43:59
consciousness by Brahman. And so mind cannot illumine or objectify Brahman.
44:04
We'll leave it at that. And now racing along a little further, Atmanam.
44:09
All of this is what? It's you. We're talking about extraordinarily abstract.
44:15
Atmanam means the self. It is you, the self. When you say it cannot be objectified by mind, it's beyond the reach of speech.
44:25
Then we get the question that, is it unknowable?
44:31
So we can't know it. You can't speak about it. You can't even think of, if you can't think about it, we can't speak about it.
44:37
You can't know it. So what's the point of this entire exercise? He says, no, Atmanam, it's your very self.
44:43
It is more than known. In fact, to know anything first, you have to be, for you to be a knower, you have to first exist.
44:50
That existence, your pre-knowership existence, that's already there.
44:55
That is what we are talking about. And then he says, Akhiladharam, the substratum of the entire universe.
45:03
This is a word for God, because in religion, God is defined, theistic religions, God is defined as the creator of the entire universe.
45:11
The existence, that which projects the entire universe.
45:17
So Akhiladharam means the substratum of the entire universe. And when you put these together, Atmanam Akhiladharam, the self,
45:24
which is the substratum of the entire universe, you get the central Vedantic teaching.
45:30
I am Brahman, that thou art. You are saying the self is that which is the substratum of the entire universe.
45:38
In the words of Meister Eckhart, the ground of my soul and the ground of God are one and the same.
45:45
That which is the reality of my soul and that which is the reality of God are one and the same.
45:51
This is exactly what is meant here. Atmanam Akhiladharam, the self, which is the foundation of the entire universe.
45:58
Literally it's saying, you are Brahman. This is the meaning.
46:04
Ashraye, I take refuge in. Now, this is a traditional way of approaching God.
46:11
But what does this mean in this context? Ashraye literally means, I take refuge in Vishnu or in Durga.
46:17
The worship of Durga is coming up. I take refuge in Durga. That's understandable. I take refuge in God, but or I refuge in the Buddha.
46:27
But what does this mean? I take refuge in myself. So it basically means here, Ashraya means the only way you take refuge in yourself
46:34
is to recognize yourself as a substratum of the entire universe. That this one reality in which the universe appears and you,
46:42
the knower of the universe appears, they are one reality. Atman is Brahman. Recognizing this is taking refuge.
46:49
The meaning of taking refuge is this. Why are we doing all this? Abhishta Siddhaye, for the fulfillment of my cherished goal.
46:58
Abhishta, cherished goal. Siddhaye, for success. What is the cherished goal?
47:05
Two meanings here. One meaning is for enlightenment.
47:11
The whole purpose is for realizing that I am Brahman. The whole of Advaita Vedanta.
47:17
That's my cherished goal. Why is that a goal? We'll see. Because if you attain that, you attain the ultimate purpose of human life,
47:24
which can be stated in two ways. One is freedom from the cycle of birth and death, which is a common trope
47:31
in all Indian philosophy, except the materialists. And the second way of putting it is attainment of fulfillment
47:38
and transcendence of sorrow. Atyantika Dukkha Nivritti, Paramananda Praptischa.
47:45
Atyantika Dukkha Nivritti means transcendence, complete transcendence of sorrow, a complete cessation of sorrow.
47:54
And Paramananda Prapti, attainment of the ultimate fulfillment, of ultimate bliss.
47:59
That is the result promised. How do you do that? Through this enlightenment. And so this enlightenment becomes my cherished goal.
48:07
That's one cherished goal. The second cherished goal is where I began. Why do you have an invocation? For the successful completion of the book, for a successful completion of our study.
48:16
So that's our more practical and immediate concern. For that purpose, I take refuge in the absolute.
48:24
That is the meaning of the first verse. That's really a lot, but basically it's all of Advaita Vedanta.
48:32
And don't worry, I won't be spending so much time on each verse as we go along. Others will sort of cruise through.
48:40
All right, let me stop here and deal with questions, comments.
48:46
Swamiji, there's a question from Shashank in the chat. Does Akhanda equals Abheda or specifically Akhanda
48:53
means no Swagata bheda? Okay, Akhanda and Abheda are the same.
49:01
Akhanda is indivisible. Abheda means no difference. Depending on these differences, you have multiple systems
49:09
of philosophy of religion. If you admit Vijatiya bheda and Swagata bheda,
49:18
then you have dualistic Vedanta. Vijatiya bheda means other than God, there are things.
49:24
And the dualistic systems say, yes, the world is there, human beings, sentient beings are there, and they are all different from each other
49:32
and they're different from God. So this is a thoroughly dualistic system.
49:37
So all of Islam and Christianity and say the theistic Judaism
49:46
and the theistic Hindu systems like Dvaita Vedanta, they are all firmly dualistic.
49:53
Except of course, in each of these traditions, there will be the mystic, those who have attained
49:59
a realization of oneness.
50:05
So that's one system. The other kind of system would be if you admit Sajatiya bheda, Brahman
50:14
and other Brahmans, then that will lead to polytheism. If you admit Swagata bheda and not other kinds of bheda, that means
50:21
internal difference, but no external difference at all, then you get Vishisthadvaita, where Brahman is one reality,
50:28
but there are internal differences. Sentient beings are there and insentient universe is there and they are all part of an organic, divine whole.
50:37
Okay. are there some raised hands? Girish ji?
50:46
Girish Yes. You have to unmute yourself. Can you hear me now? Yes, I can hear you.
50:52
Okay. I'm afraid I have to go back to basics. I keep going back and tying myself into knots about these things.
50:59
So the concept of Brahman, of Akhandam, as we are saying, is actually born in
51:05
empirical domain of our human minds. It would seem thus that the concept of non-dual Brahman is a mental creation,
51:16
an abstraction, perhaps even a convenient fiction to explain our experiences.
51:24
But on the other hand, our minds which are conceiving this are also illusory because they are part of the Maya projection.
51:35
Yes. So it becomes sort of a circular thing in my mind. And I keep asking myself, so what is real?
51:42
I mean, are we inventing Brahman and are Brahman inventing us?
51:48
or and for that matter, I do extend that further, is I understand
51:54
and people have said, and I think you have said too, that Advaita is a concept and or a model.
52:00
And is it a model that is closer to, to say Sankhya or yoga?
52:07
And so please explain, expand on that. Yes. One thing about this invocation is it's actually not a teaching.
52:16
It just seems to encompass the entire Advaita system. What we just heard here is what we are going to study throughout this book
52:24
and in all the Upanishads and so on and so forth. It's, they're not taking it as anything accomplished or something that you have to believe in.
52:30
It's just a sketch of what's to come. But straight answer to your question would be, what is the truth here?
52:37
Even this Brahman and all of this, these seem to be concepts. True. The truth is you.
52:43
What they are pointing out is one inescapable fact, whether you are a materialist, atheist, theist, Vedantin, whatever you believe in,
52:53
it is you who are believing in it. It is you who disbelieve in it. It is you who understand it.
52:59
You who fail to understand it. You will remember or fail to remember all of that is you. What is this you?
53:05
This is the inquiry in Vedanta. We'll see. So the straight answer of the Vedantin would be you.
53:14
You are the truth. You are the truth. All truth appears to you.
53:20
You validate or disvalidate invalidate any kind of statement or proposition.
53:30
That way Vedanta is very tight. Is it close to Sankhya? In some ways, but it is much more revolutionary than Sankhya.
53:39
Sankhya, for example, is actually very elegant and not very difficult to swallow, you know, because all that Sankhya says is
53:47
that you are pure consciousness and apart from you there is this material nature. You have appropriated a part of material nature into your identity.
53:55
That's why you're in trouble. You think you are this body mind, but actually body mind is objective.
54:01
They are parts of nature and you are a consciousness apart from body mind and that's it.
54:06
Why is this easier to understand? Because our general structure of experience is subject-object.
54:13
We are subjects, we experience objects and Sankhya just takes that one step further.
54:19
It puts what we thought were subject, this body and my mind and my thoughts and puts them in the category of objects and see
54:25
the resultant freedom and that's it. It stops them. But Advaita Vedanta says, goes much further.
54:33
It goes on to say that you this pure consciousness, it follows the Sankhya and track of thinking and then
54:39
where Sankhya stops, it goes further. It says you the pure consciousness, are you different from all these other people?
54:46
There are 63 people here today. Are there 63 pure consciousnesses or one? Advaita makes the radical claim that we are one pure consciousness
54:55
and there are arguments to prove this and ways to understand this. It goes further.
55:01
That which seems to be an other to consciousness, here we have Vijatiya bheda, other than consciousness is non-conscious,
55:08
insentient, material. Is that really separate from you or is it in some sense you?
55:18
And Advaita Vedanta makes the even further radical claim. This entire universe which we are conscious of, it is nothing other
55:25
than we the consciousness. That's the meaning of the falsity of the universe. It's false as a separate entity apart from Brahman.
55:33
It is Brahman. All these differences are appearances which is the great doctrine
55:39
of Vivatta, the theory of appearance. Okay. Let's see. Other questions?
55:46
Shekhar? Namaste Swamiji. Namaste. I hope I'm not jumping ahead but usually a person like you
55:56
and your reflection are identical. So is it correct to say Brahman alone exists and the world is a reflection of Brahman?
56:05
Let me stop you right there. You and your reflection are identical. So when you look at your reflection in the mirror,
56:11
what do you mean by identical? The reflection in the mirror is similar to your face.
56:18
But it's not you. Identical means one and the same, only one reality. But the reflection in the mirror is not the same as your face.
56:27
If you have 10 mirrors, you will see 10 reflections. So clearly the reflection is different.
56:33
The reflection is not identical to your face. It's actually identical to the mirror. It looks like your face.
56:39
So 10 mirrors, 10 reflections. If the mirror is concave, it will not even look like your face.
56:46
The mirror is convex, it will not even look like your face. So reflection is never identical to the original.
56:52
Reflection is rather an appearance of the original given a reflective medium. That's one way of putting it.
56:58
So is the world a reflection of Brahman? Reflection of Brahman, yes and no.
57:04
We will see later on, all this will come up, idea of Maya, what is Brahman,
57:09
what is the Atman, how did we become these sentient beings? We seem to be different from Brahman.
57:15
How does this world appear? All of that will be discussed and the whole methodology of Vedanta will be discussed. I won't go into it now.
57:21
Yes. Next. Puneeta ji?
57:29
Pranam Swamiji. Namaste. So one of the things that this Akhilaharam brings to me is in
57:37
his own humorous ways that Alan Watts would point to our own experience
57:44
of going into deep sleep and he would say jokingly, just reflect on
57:50
the thing that if you go into deep sleep and never wake up.
57:55
And he says if you reflect on it more seriously, this whole thing
58:01
kind of brings more reality to the fact that we are the substrate
58:07
because the world as we know it won't exist anymore. So only when we wake up, the world comes into being as we know it in terms
58:15
of all the differences and me and you and everybody else.
58:21
But if you never woke up, that's it. And he actually, funnily enough, he supposedly died that way.
58:29
I mean, he went into deep sleep and never woke up. So I don't know. I mean, if you could, I know you are the one
58:35
who introduced me to Alan Watts. So you probably know what he was pointing to or was it something just for fun?
58:43
Yes. This is the influence of Mandukya. Yeah. So this is the advantage and the problem of having started at the top.
58:52
So we are right now starting from the base camp, building up, you know, getting the building blocks of Advaita Vedanta and slowly building up.
58:58
We'll come to that eventually. Mandukya takes a very high stand, a non-dualistic stand.
59:05
Everything, you are the witness of the presence and absence of experiences, presence of experience or presence of objects,
59:13
presence of objects, waking state, people and the world, your own body, dream state,
59:20
no external world, but it seems to be like that in the mind, still object. They are mental objects and the absence of objects, which is deep sleep,
59:30
a blankness, which is experienced. But the attention is always towards the object
59:36
or the absence of the objects. We are immersed. We are enthralled in the waking state.
59:41
We are bewitched by our dreams and we are dulled and deadened by the blankness of deep sleep.
59:48
But who is the one, what is the one to which these three are shining and disappearing?
59:55
That is what Alan Watts is pointing towards and Vedanta is pointing towards. And it's a very stunning claim.
1:00:01
Whatever you see in the world right now, this entire vast universe, so full
1:00:08
of temptation, so full of trouble, so full of anxiety is exactly the same
1:00:13
what you experience in deep sleep. There is nothing more right now than what was there in deep sleep.
1:00:21
Can you imagine? Is that scary or is that a big, big relief?
1:00:30
Relief. Yes, if it is true, now you can experience this world, both yourself and everything
1:00:38
around you with great peace, with the deep peace of Sushupti. In fact, don't fall asleep, but with the complete rest and unconcern
1:00:46
of Sushupti, deep sleep, you can actually experience this world. With what Swami Vivekananda called the intense activity
1:00:54
in the midst of eternal calm. Eternal calm is what you experience in your real nature.
1:01:04
Okay, good question. But several steps ahead of what we are doing right now. Prabir babu?
1:01:13
Yes. Pranam. Maharaj, Pranam. Namaskar. I have a question.
1:01:21
Why did Sankhya need to have multiple Purushas and not just one Purusha
1:01:26
to explain their philosophy? I mean, I'm just trying to think that they could have just one Purusha
1:01:33
and Prakriti and several body minds and they could still have the same. What's the significance of having multiple Purushas,
1:01:40
each one of us being a separate Purusha? Sankhya is fundamentally pluralistic.
1:01:46
They gave five major arguments to say why we require several Purushas.
1:01:53
They take pluralism as given. So, multiple external realities, which are all products of Prakriti
1:02:01
and each of us has separate pure consciousness.
1:02:08
Why separate? The arguments which they gave are like this, that if we were
1:02:14
one pure consciousness, one Purusha, then the bondage of one would be the bondage of all, the liberation of one.
1:02:20
If my Guru became liberated, then we would all become, I would become liberated. Everybody would become liberated. If the death of one would be the death of everybody, the birth of one would be
1:02:29
the birth of everybody, because we are all one. The waking of one would be the waking of everybody.
1:02:35
If one fell asleep, then everybody would fall asleep. But you know, these arguments do not hold water. We can easily see that here you are importing properties
1:02:44
of body and mind into the Purusha. It's the body which is born. If one body is born, it does not mean that all bodies will be born.
1:02:51
So why will you say that all Purushas are born if the body is born? So on. But that's the way they look at it.
1:02:59
If you take that step, one more step there, that it's all one consciousness. Advaita Vedanta at that point asks, if we are many consciousnesses,
1:03:07
how do you distinguish? Why would you say there are many pure consciousnesses?
1:03:13
There is no answer to that. So Advaita would say that we are one pure consciousness.
1:03:18
All distinctions are of body and mind. And notice the first word of this book is akhandam,
1:03:25
no distinction, no difference. So no distinction and no difference means all these distinctions and differences
1:03:32
which Sankhya talks about, all the other systems talk about, they are experienced, but they are not real.
1:03:38
This is one thing we have to understand, which Advaita Vedanta catches hold of one thing. Notice one thing, that the differences in the world cannot be denied.
1:03:50
We are experiencing it. Don't you experience it? There are so many people.
1:03:55
We see so many people, we hear so many things, we note the presence of so many millions and billions of entities.
1:04:02
So that cannot be, our experience cannot be denied. If you deny, you say, no, you are not seeing many people.
1:04:08
You're just seeing one reality. That is madness. Then you cannot proceed. You cannot proceed with any kind of philosophy.
1:04:15
But what Advaita cleverly does is, Advaita says, we are not denying that you experience division.
1:04:22
We are not denying that you experience difference, but that difference or division which you experience,
1:04:29
is it real or is it apparent? Often when there is unity, we experience difference.
1:04:38
Dreams, in our dream world, we experience so many things, so many people, so many places, so many events, world of difference.
1:04:47
And yet when we wake up, what do we say? It was all our mind only.
1:04:52
We experience a variety of golden ornaments and yet we know it is gold only.
1:04:59
We experience 10,000 waves in the Atlantic ocean. We know it is one mass of water only.
1:05:04
So, multiplicity can be experienced with an underlying oneness that we know.
1:05:12
And that's what Advaita Vedanta takes advantage of. Advaita Vedanta never denies that you experience multiplicity,
1:05:17
but questions what you experience, is it real or is it an appearance? And we have enough examples of appearances, errors, dreams, you know,
1:05:26
Bhranti, Bhrama, which means error. So Advaita makes a big deal of that, uses that difference.
1:05:32
So this is the crucial point. There can be a difference between experience and reality. The famous British idealist philosopher, Bradley, he said in his book, Appearance
1:05:44
and Reality, what appears is not real and the reality never appears.
1:05:51
He's playing on the word appearance, in English, two meanings, something that you experience is an appearance and something
1:05:58
that is pretending is an appearance. He appears to be a nice person. What do you mean? What do you mean?
1:06:03
He's not a nice person in reality. That means there's a difference between appearance and reality. That's what that difference Advaita Vedanta exploits.
1:06:13
If you say there's only one reality, non-dual and that's it.
1:06:18
No, no, no. Then you have to explain why it is, why this multiplicity is appearing. So that is the core meaning of Brahmasatyam.
1:06:25
Brahman alone is real, Jagat Mithya, the world is an appearance. And the clinching thing is you are Brahman.
1:06:33
So yeah. Sushmaji.
1:06:42
Sushmaji, you have to unmute yourself. I know I'm a beginner, so I'm so happy that you started this book for me.
1:06:51
I'm very happy for that. I have a question. Maybe I don't know. I was wondering, you said, Atmanam Akhiladharam.
1:07:03
So do you have to realize it or you have, I have to tell my mind, I have to keep telling, no, I am this.
1:07:10
You have to realize it. As clearly as you know that you are Sushma, as clearly as that,
1:07:17
you have to realize it should become a natural fact. So for that, you have to understand what is Akhiladharam,
1:07:23
what is meant by Atman. And then the point of Advaita Vedanta is that this will become clear to us.
1:07:29
It will first become intellectually clear to us, and then it will deepen into enlightenment. Ok. Thank you
1:07:36
Vedanta makes the claim that it's already a fact. And it's very unfortunate that we don't see it.
1:07:42
And Vedanta just wants to point out to us what is the fact and help us to see it. And makes the promise, if you see it, that is enlightenment.
1:07:51
Already an accomplished fact, Siddha. Siddha means it's an accomplished fact. You don't have to actually do anything.
1:07:58
You have to realize what already exists. If you realize that, you will be free of it. So all our suffering is born of a mass of ignorance, ignorance about ourselves.
1:08:08
It is like a person who has delusions, maybe psychotic or schizophrenic.
1:08:14
And the person, you know, there's nothing wrong with the world. There is nothing wrong with the world.
1:08:20
But that person feels terrible. People are persecuting me. You know, Beautiful Mind, the movie was there.
1:08:25
There's so much problem is there. And you know, there's nothing wrong at all. And the person could just snap out of that and experience the real world as it is,
1:08:33
would see that all the problems are solved. Similarly, in Advaita Vedanta, you already are Brahman.
1:08:39
There's absolutely no problem here. You are fine as it is, but you have to investigate
1:08:45
your own nature to discover that. Yeah.
1:08:51
Hello. Yes. Oh, yeah. Hi, Swami.
1:08:57
Nice to have you back. So I have no problem. So whenever I go somewhere, I try to see the oneness in everything and in everyone.
1:09:08
And today I saw a number of homeless and I usually always give a little.
1:09:13
But now I see them with different eyes and I suffer more
1:09:18
and I can no longer just pass without helping. But I don't have the financial means to help everyone in New York.
1:09:27
But I find a true struggle with it now. Well, by before I said, OK, I cannot help everyone.
1:09:34
But today I I suffered because I literally saw
1:09:40
the underlying oneness. I saw the divine consciousness. I saw God in everyone suffering, going through the garbage.
1:09:47
How do I deal with that? If I if I would have the means, of course, I would go around distributing money, but I don't.
1:09:53
And do it in two ways. One is at the practical level. Do something, take some action which you can, which is possible for you.
1:10:01
Maybe you donate it even if to one individual or to an organization or something like that.
1:10:06
You take action within your within Gabriel's limits, what is possible for Gabriel.
1:10:13
And you know, that's very little. There's very little that we can do to alleviate the sufferings of the world.
1:10:19
So you pray to the Lord to pray to God for to bless them and to help people. These are the two things that you can do.
1:10:26
Remember, philosophically speaking, you are making a jump. The oneness within which which is within everybody.
1:10:34
That's one thing. And Gabriel. Gabriel is a particular instance of that oneness.
1:10:40
Gabriel is not the oneness. The reality of the intellectual level. But I'm trying to apply the knowledge and I feel the more I apply the knowledge,
1:10:50
when you apply the knowledge, these do these two things. One is take some practical step to help people.
1:10:57
I do. And you do and pray to the Lord to help them.
1:11:02
Pray to the Lord. Ultimately, it's the Lord who helps. We do very little. So pour out your suffering in in sincere prayer to God
1:11:11
to help those who are in suffering. But can we not be the instrument to serve him?
1:11:17
You are. I mean, I worked 32 years for the United Nations. I worked in Africa and developing countries.
1:11:22
I mean, I feel and instrument. If you feel that way, then then only one can become
1:11:29
a true instrument in the hands of God. Then only Karma Yoga becomes real, that you are worshipping God
1:11:36
in all beings. Yes, that's true service. All right, Gabriel. Thank you.we are ending with that We thank you.
1:11:42
beautiful note Yes. Let me just one quick chat. There's some questions from Charles.
1:11:48
If I am Brahman equals I am God, then how can God create me? Okay. I am Brahman is equal to I am God.
1:11:55
And how can God create me? Okay. These are the things which the Vedanta Sara will deal with in great detail.
1:12:02
Notice there are three things here. I, Brahman, God. And initially, they all three will be different.
1:12:11
God is different. I am different. And Brahman is the absolute. So we begin with this.
1:12:18
We actually with God, individual and world, a triangle of God, individual and world.
1:12:24
I am the individual. Here is the world that is clear to me. And there is something called God, which religion tells me, holy people
1:12:32
tell me that there is something called God. We begin with this triangle. This is the triangle of religion.
1:12:38
Advaita Vedanta wants to say that there is an ultimate reality, Brahman, which appears as this triangle.
1:12:45
As this triangle of God, world and individual is one Brahman which appears as all three.
1:12:52
Not only that you are Brahman, God is also Brahman. And the world is an appearance of Brahman.
1:12:59
It's a superimposition on Brahman. So we'll leave it at that. There'll be a very detailed discussion towards the end of the book.
1:13:08
In what sense am I Brahman? Om Shanti Shanti Shanti Hari Om Tat Sat Shri Ramakrishnarpanamastu
1:13:25
Thank you very much.
