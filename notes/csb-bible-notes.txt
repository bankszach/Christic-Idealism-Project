Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Primary modern English Bible translation for:
  - Scripture citations in the paper,
  - theological and exegetical grounding of claims about Christ, Trinity, creation, evil, etc.
- Gives us a consistent textual basis when we connect the ontology to explicit biblical passages.

Key metadata (from front matter)
--------------------------------

Stated goals and philosophy (from “Introduction to the CSB”)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Goals:
  - Provide an accurate translation in contemporary English for a global audience.
  - Suitable for personal study, sermon prep, devotions, memorization.
  - Clear and understandable for public reading and sharing.
  - Affirm the authority and truthfulness of Scripture.
- Translation philosophy:
  - Positions itself between strict **formal equivalence** (“word-for-word”) and **dynamic equivalence**:
    - Seeks to balance accuracy to original wording with clarity of meaning in contemporary English.
    - Emphasizes readability without abandoning close attention to the original text.
  - Often described as “optimal equivalence” in CSB materials (not yet seen in the small extract but standard CSB language).

Use within the project
----------------------
- Default translation:
  - When the paper quotes Scripture in English, we can default to CSB unless there is a strong reason to use a different translation.
- Citation practice:
  - Follow CSB’s required credit line when quoting, e.g.:
    - “Unless otherwise noted, Scripture quotations are taken from the Christian Standard Bible®, Copyright © 2017 by Holman Bible Publishers. Used by permission.”
  - Keep within CSB’s permissions (no complete books, no more than 1,000 verses, and <50% of the work).
- Theological alignment:
  - CSB is broadly evangelical; helpful when engaging contemporary theology and church use.
  - For deeper doctrinal work we will still lean on patristic and systematic sources (Athanasius, Augustine, Rahner, etc.), but CSB provides the shared scriptural text those traditions expound.

Key passage clusters for this project
-------------------------------------
Note: we will not try to “summarize the whole Bible,” but focus on clusters that directly support and constrain the Wholeframe ontology. References are given without quoting the text (we will quote selectively in the paper as needed, within CSB permissions).
