Big-picture role for Wholeframe project
---------------------------------------
- Extends Wolfram’s “Ruliad” / computational universe ideas into:
  - a proposed general account of what’s distinctive about living systems (“bulk orchestration”),
  - the notion of a **rulial ensemble** (ensemble of rules, not just states),
  - the interplay between **computational irreducibility** and **computationally simple purposes/fitness functions**.
- For our ontology:
  - Provides a technical story for “value gradients” and “aim” in terms of:
    - simple fitness functions operating over rule-spaces,
    - pockets of **computational reducibility** within a sea of irreducibility,
    - “mechanoidal” behavior as visible structure emerging from purpose-driven selection.
  - Offers a bridge between:
    - Whole as underlying computational structure (Ruliad-like),
    - slices as locally orchestrated subsystems selected under constraints.

Core ideas (from the excerpt)
-----------------------------
1. Bulk orchestration in living systems
   - Key claim:
     - Living systems are characterized by extensive **orchestration** down to molecular scales.
     - Molecules do not just diffuse randomly as in simple liquids or gels.
     - Instead, there are many active mechanisms—molecular machines, complex pathways—that orchestrate behavior.
   - Question:
     - What is the general result or characterization of such “bulk orchestration”?
     - Can we describe it independently of specific biochemical details?

2. Purposes, simplicity, and computational irreducibility
   - Central theme:
     - Consider systems that are **adapted for an overall purpose**.
     - At first glance, one might think behavior is too system-specific to admit universal description.
   - Wolfram’s move:
     - If the **purpose** (or fitness function) is **computationally simple**, and the underlying system exhibits **computational irreducibility**, then:
       - certain universal features arise in behavior.
   - Computational irreducibility:
     - Forces unpredictability and randomness (like in the Second Law).
   - But irreducibility **contains** “pockets of computational reducibility”:
     - regions where simpler, more predictable behavior occurs.
   - Achieving a computationally simple purpose:
     - requires **tapping into** these pockets of reducibility and organizing them.

3. Mechanoidal behavior and mechanism-like pockets
   - When an overall simple purpose is being achieved:
     - small-scale “mechanism-like phenomena” (pockets of reducibility) become more manifest.
   - Wolfram calls this “**mechanoidal behavior**”:
     - behavior where identifiable mechanisms operate locally,
     - orchestrated together at scale (“bulk orchestration”) to achieve the purpose.
   - This yields:
     - a trace of the system’s purpose visible in its microscopic behavior.

4. Rulial ensemble: ensembles of rules, not just states
   - Analogy with statistical mechanics:
     - In gases, we consider ensembles of microstates of molecules under fixed laws.
     - Taking statistical averages over these ensembles yields macroscopic gas properties.
   - Biology is different:
     - Different genomes effectively define different **rules** (developmental and operational rules for organisms).
   - Rulial ensemble:
     - ensemble over possible **rules** (not just states),
     - but, for biology, constrained to rules that produce viable organisms (have passed selection for some fitness function).
   - The key: we may not know the precise fitness function, but:
     - assuming the fitness function is **computationally simple** is enough to deduce structural properties of the rulial ensemble.

5. Simplicity of fitness functions and evolution
   - Wolfram’s recent claim:
     - Biological evolution is possible because fitness functions are computationally simple.
     - If fitness functions were too complex, evolution (search over rule space) would be intractable.
   - Evolution is seen as:
     - interplay between simple fitness functions and underlying computational irreducibility.
   - Result:
     - with only the assumption of fitness-function simplicity, one can begin to derive general principles of bulk orchestration from the rulial ensemble.

6. Two explanatory levels: mechanisms vs goals
   - Two approaches to explaining system behavior:
     - “Bottom-up”:
       - describe underlying rules/mechanisms by which the system operates.
     - “Top-down”:
       - describe what the system achieves (goal/purpose).
   - Usually these are hard to mix.
   - Wolfram’s claim:
     - Thinking in terms of the rulial ensemble:
       - lets us understand both:
         - the upward effect of underlying rules,
         - the downward effect of overall purposes,
       - in a unified conceptual framework.

Connections to Wholeframe ontology
----------------------------------
1. Whole vs Ruliad / rulial ensemble
   - Wholeframe’s **Whole**:
     - undivided reality, including all possible ways of appearing.
   - Wolfram’s **Ruliad** / rulial ensemble:
     - ensemble of all possible computational rules and their execution histories.
   - Structural resonance:
     - Whole ≈ Ruliad-level underlying structure;
     - slices ≈ particular orchestrated sub-regions under specific rules and fitness constraints.
   - We can:
     - use rulial language when we want a more explicit computational picture of the Whole’s possibility space.

2. Value gradient, aim, and fitness functions
   - Wholeframe **lean/value gradient**:
     - tendency toward coherence, life, mutuality, self-giving love.
   - Wolfram **fitness functions**:
     - computationally simple criteria that shape which rules survive in the rulial ensemble.
   - Mapping:
     - In the biological/physical domain, fitness functions are a local expression of “which patterns survive” within the Whole.
     - Our value gradient adds:
       - a normative layer: patterns are not just viable, but aligned with deeper coherence and love.
   - Aim:
     - corresponds to **local choices of which pockets of reducibility to exploit**, which rules to follow, and which mechanisms to build.

3. Pattern source and pockets of reducibility
   - Pattern source:
     - deep configuration of tendencies, memories, values, etc. in a slice.
   - Pockets of reducibility:
     - regions of the underlying computation where behavior is predictable and structured.
   - Link:
     - A slice’s pattern source can be viewed as:
       - the internalization of certain pockets of reducibility (stable, mechanism-like structures) selected over its life (training run).
     - These patterns are what attention and aim operate on, orchestrating them toward or against alignment.

4. Attention and bulk orchestration
   - Wolfram’s **bulk orchestration**:
     - coordination of many mechanism-like components to serve a purpose.
   - Wholeframe **attention**:
     - the Whole’s movement through a slice, selecting and weighting experiences and responses.
   - Synthesis:
     - Attention is the local “controller” that:
       - selects which mechanism-like subpatterns to amplify,
       - shapes bulk orchestration within the slice.

5. Training runs and rulial exploration
   - Life as **training run**:
     - Whole exploring a particular configuration of constraints, patterns, aims.
   - Rulial ensemble:
     - exploration of rule-space constrained by simple fitness functions.
   - Analogy:
     - Each life corresponds to:
       - a trajectory through rulial state-space under given rules,
       - whose results (pattern source changes) are then integrated into the Whole.
   - This supports:
     - our idea that patterns (not narrative ego) are what persist and shape the Whole’s effective structure.

How to use this source in `paper/main.tex`
-----------------------------------------
- In the early discussion of the Whole and slices:
  - Reinforce the connection to computational universes and the Ruliad (building on `wolfram2002nks`, `wolfram2021ruliad`).
  - Briefly mention:
    - rulial ensemble as a computational analogue of Whole-level possibility.
- In sections on value gradient and alignment:
  - Use the idea of **simple fitness functions** vs **computational irreducibility** to:
    - give a naturalized picture of why some patterns can be selected and orchestrated at all.
- In Pattern Source / Attention / Lives as Training Runs:
  - Draw on **pockets of reducibility** and **mechanoidal behavior** to:
    - describe how stable subpatterns emerge and become exploitable routines within a slice.

Open questions / cautions
-------------------------
- Scope mismatch:
  - Wolfram’s account is:
    - computational and physical/biological, largely non-normative.
  - Our ontology:
    - adds strong value and Christological commitments.
  - Need to be explicit about:
    - where we are just borrowing structure (rulial ensemble, irreducibility),
    - where we are adding theological interpretation (lean toward self-giving love).
- Complexity of exposition:
  - Ruliad and rulial ensembles are already heavy ideas.
  - In Stage 1 of the paper:
    - refer lightly to this work,
    - save any detailed formalization for later, or for a technical appendix.
